Pros:Scrolling 5/5-Scrolling on Windows has always be light years behind Mac - even when using a track pad on Windows vs a stepped scroll wheel, the scroll feels jerky and inconsistent while Macs always feel buttery smooth and fluid no matter what device you use. This mouse with the scroll wheel in free spin ""MagSpeed"" mode is the closest I've ever felt a Windows machine scroll like a Mac. It really is super nice. I almost never put it into the stepped mode. I see a lot of comments talking about inconsistent scrolling on this mouse and I cannot say I have experienced that. For context I am using the Lightspeed connector and not Bluetooth, which I'm sure plays a large factor with the free spin. Let's look at the math behind that. Logitech claims Lightspeed has a 1ms response time, while bluetooth can be as low as 34ms but is often times more around 100-300ms. In ""MagSpeed"" mode at full spin speed, this mouse will do 1000 lines per second. So yes, for your computer to ingest those line signals it's going to need a 1ms response rate. I am also using Logitech's Options+ software which may also play a role in scrolling stability.Ergonomics 4/5-Ergonomics feel really nice to me, but borderline too small. My glove size is between M and L (or 8 and 9), so if you are an L or larger hand maybe this won't work for you, but everyone's comfort is different. The thumb and palm sculpting is really nice and fills the hand nicely (depending on your size). The matte finish texturing also feels nice, I just hope it doesn't deteriorate over time.Logitech Options+ Software 5/5-Being able to program the button map per application is a game changer (for me) and has really improved my work flow. DPI can also be adjusted here.Gesture Button 5/5-The lower thumb ""gesture"" button gives back Mac like gestures to mouse users, something I sorta forgot I was missing but use it all the time now.DPI 5/5-I found out 8k DPI is too high for my monitor, which was one of the deciding factors for me between this and the MX 3. I have a 49inch ultrawide 32:9 ratio monitor at 5120X1440 resolution, and I could feel the lower DPI of my old mouse on this monitor. However this one set to 8k is crazy fast - way too fast - so I currently have it set to 55% speed. Again lets look at the math - if you have a 8k monitor, this mouse set to max DPI is going to get from the left most side of the screen to the right most side in just 1inch of mouse travel. That's fast - you may find that 8K is overkill for your needs. That said, this is all easily adjustable in the Options+ software and it does feel WAY smoother than any mouse or trackpad I've used. I've yet to use this on glass - I'm sure the DPI helps in that regard.Click 4/5-I honestly thought I wouldn't like having a silent click feel, and I like clicky keyboards as well, but it's growing on me. Enough so to make me rethink the type of keyboard I'm using. Click feel and sound ultimately comes down to preference, so all I can say is you feel the click, but it's barely audible. Search youtube or even Amazon reviews, I've seen sound comparisons with this mouse so judge for yourself.Cons:Ergonomics:-The lost point above is due to size - my fourth finger does rest on the desk, which was true of my previous mouse as well so I'm used to it but the experience would be better if there was a rest point or wing on the right side of this mouse. I don't know, this is again preference and hold style but for me I think I would have given a higher score for ergonomics if my pinky didn't touch the desk.Click:-Still on the fence on how silent the click is. Feel is good, sound is... well not there. So if you're used to a satisfying click sound this is going to be jarring.

I wish that there was a fusion between the Logitech G502 Hero wireless mouse, Logitech MX 3 mouse, and the ReDragon M801P Sniper Pro wireless mouse and the Razer Basilisk Ultimate. I don't understand why all other mice on the market do not have a hyper scroll capability yet. If the ReDragon M801P mouse had this hyper scroll wheel. I would love it because of the format of being able to wrest my ring finger on the mouse channel. It is so hard to find a good ergonomic mouse on the market today with great features.If that M801P ergonomic palm and finger wrest shape, as well as the scroll wheel placement and the RGB lighting was combined with the click ability of G502 Hero mouse buttons and button placement (including the middle finger length of the right mouse click). Was merged with the MX 3 mouse's perfected hyper scroll wheel, the thumb wheel functionality and programmability, as well as the ergonomic thumb rest shape, it would be the absolute perfect mouse! I totally had no idea how useful the thumbwheel would be until I started using. Its programmability makes it so useful!I found that with the functionality of the MX 3 Mouse, I am so much faster and enjoy doing the work now that I found tedious before. I get so much done; it is ridiculous! The combination of using this mouse with Logitech G915 keyboard makes me so much faster that I don't want to stop getting things done. I found that I can do stuff that I never could before typing wise with the G915. That is why I'm writing so much on this review. It doesn't even bother me at all since it doesn't take very long to do this. Work kind of feels like videogaming right now.Basically, the Razer Basilisk Ultimate has a RGB superior lighting capability as well as a better overall ergonomic shape feel than the G502 Hero. I had purchased it first and ended up returning it because the right click was missing clicks and the scroll wheel adjustment didn't reach the level of not ratcheting at all. The G502 simply had better clicking buttons and the hyper scroll wheel over the Basilisk Ultimate. Though the placement of the hyper scroll wheel forces one to shift their hand too much because its is to close to the second joint on the index finger. That is why I ended up returning the G502 and purchasing the MX 3 mouse.Recently I was forced to search for a new ergonomic wireless mouse.I previously had the original Logitech M705 portable mouse for around a decade. Finally wore it out to the point where the receiver would not connect. I loved the hyper scroll functionality of the mouse, as well as the ergonomics of thumb rest pocket curve. The forward and back buttons were a welcome addition, though I had to move my thumb far to reach them. The Issue with this mouse was that it was too small since it was meant for portability.When the original MX mouse came onto the market, I had no desire for it since the ergonomics and features were poor.Before purchasing this MX 3 Mouse I acquired the G502 Hero wireless and it was awesome except for the positioning of the scroll wheel, the thumb rest curvature, the coating on the mouse caused me to sweat and the mouse would slip in my hand, and finally the width of the mouse was too small for properly wresting one’s hand on. The MX 3 mouse wheel without the rubber grip is way better for feel and longevity over the G502 Hero wireless. The rubber on my original M705 mouse had worn loose after about a year or two of use and I had to cut it off in order to continue using the hyper scroll functionality. The G502 has a rubber on it which probably means it will loosen over time.The bad thing about the MX 3 mouse is that the forward and back buttons are small cheap plastic buttons that are difficult to press, unlike the G502 buttons. The hump that is put into the palm wrest behind the thumb wheel is just overkill and bad ergonomics. You end up having a hard surface jutting into the root bone socket of your index finger. The curvature of the M801P is much more conducive to the natural ergonomic flow of the palm.The right and left mouse click buttons on the MX 3 mouse are too loud and put up too much resistance. The right click's size is too narrow to allow for clicking all the time without running into the outer border of the mouse. The G502 had the perfect balance of size, shape and reactivity in comparison to the MX 3 mouse. A major issue I run into with the MX 3 mouse is that my index will accidentally brush ever so slightly against the hyper scroll wheel when it is on infinite scroll, and I am trying to rotate the thumb wheel while navigating an image gallery. This causes the gallery to start moving based on the infinite scroll.This issue could be avoided if the MX 3 mouse had finger channels like the G502, or the Razer Basilisk or even the M801P has. Though the M801P's right click is not as long and therefore it is possible for one's finger to slip over the end of it.I hope in the future Logitech, Razer, or ReDragon will implement the changes that I mentioned here and make the perfect mouse that could be used for either gaming or productivity.

I've been using this mouse for a year and I have to say, it has exceeded my expectations. The ergonomic design is comfortable to use for long periods of time and the ultrafast scrolling feature has made navigating through documents and websites a breeze. The customization options are also a great bonus, allowing me to tailor the mouse to my specific needs. The USB-C, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity options make it easy to use with a variety of devices.First of all, the ergonomic design is top-notch. The shape of the mouse fits comfortably in my hand and the thumb rest and gesture button allow me to use the mouse without straining my hand or wrist. This is especially important for me as I tend to use a mouse for long periods of time and have experienced discomfort with other models in the past. The Logitech MX Master 3 has completely eliminated that issue for me.The ultrafast scrolling feature is also a game-changer. I frequently have to scroll through long documents and websites, and the smooth and precise scrolling on the MX Master 3 makes that task much easier and more efficient. It's a small detail, but it has made a big difference in my daily workflow.The customization options are also a great feature. I was able to program the buttons to perform specific actions that I use frequently, such as copying and pasting or opening my email. This has saved me a lot of time and effort as I no longer have to navigate through menus or use keyboard shortcuts to perform these tasks.One of the standout features of the Logitech MX Master 3 is the Flow cross-computer control. This allows you to use the mouse to seamlessly control multiple computers at the same time. You can even copy and paste files and text between the computers, which is a huge time-saver.To use the Flow feature, you simply need to install the Logitech Options software on each of the computers you want to connect. From there, you can easily switch between the computers using the mouse and keyboard, as if you were using just one device. I've found the Flow feature to be extremely useful in my work as it allows me to easily move between multiple projects without having to constantly switch between devices. It's a unique and innovative feature that sets the MX Master 3 apart from other mice on the market.Some potential concerns: -Price on the higher end -Not left-hand friendly -Size not for smaller hands -Scroll wheel may be too smooth for someOverall, the Logitech MX Master 3 is a fantastic mouse that has greatly improved my productivity and comfort while using a computer. It's a high-quality product that I would highly recommend to anyone in need of a reliable and comfortable wireless mouse.

Pros:1.) The fact that the scroll wheel is all metal or at least gets rid of the stepped plastic insert from the 2S.Cleaning that part of the mouse was a minor quibble on the 2S nonetheless. Either way, the all metal scroll wheel feels a lot better to use now that it's all metal and the actual groves in the wheel feel much better to touch.2.) The silent clicks on the right and left clicker are a positive in my mind.3.) USB-C is a plus.Charging is faster although I didn't bother to time the exact difference between the 3S and my 2S. Future-proofing is a good thing given that the future is USB-C4.) Bigger horizontal scroll wheel with a caveat though (see con#1).No plastic grippy insert for the the horizonal scroll wheel on the 3S which is a pro or a con depending on how you use the horizonal scroll wheel. I didn't mind it either way on the 2S and not having it on the 3S is the same for me.Cons:1.) Logitech moved the dedicated side buttons lower and placed the horizontal scroll wheel above the dedicated side buttons.That means my thumb is constantly touching the lower of the two buttons on the left side which is not my preference. Compared to the MX Master 2S, the 3S two side buttons are too close to my thumb now which means I accidentally click the (default) forward button on the 3S more than I ever have when I used the MX Master 2S.2.) The rubber or soft-touch plastic that surrounds where your palm goes is way too slippery for my taste.The MS Master 2S had a grippy soft outer rubber layer for the thumb and the palm which made it much easier to hold and grip. Unfortunately the MX Master 3S is very slippery and harder to grip. The MX Master 3S is definitely much easier to clean but holding the mouse requires me to use my pinky and right ring finger more often. Compared to when I used my Master MX 3S, I could easily and swiftly wander with the 3S using only my pinky and thumb to hold the right and left sides respectively.3.) Activation/press area of hidden thumb button is much smaller on the 3S compared to the larger area on the 2S.There's a little grove/pit that you press down on using your thumb with the 3S and it's much smaller than I would like. Not only is it smaller on the 3S, the position of the area/grove is too far behind where my thumb rests. I have to scrunch up my thumb to reach back on the mouse to click it which is annoying. The 2S had a much better placement and the entire area your thumb rest on was clickable. Yes, the 2S had that hard plastic edge that made it harder to clean and allowed things to get into which made it even harder to clean but since I always have clean hands it was never an issue for me with I used the 2S hidden thumb button.4.) The 3S has a smaller palm area.Depending on your preference, this is a con or a pro or both. For me, this is a con. I have small hands so I liked how much more bulkier the MX Master 2S was. The bulkier 2S was easier for me to hold because I didn't have to scrunch up my palm in order to make more contact with the palm rest. This also means less area for your palm to rest on which I do. If you don't rest your palm on the mouse as much, this won't be a con for you.Not a pro but not a con either:1.) No storage area for the Bolt receiver on the 3S anywhere just like the 2S unfortunately.I don't travel a lot so it's not a problem at the moment but I would have still liked to see a tiny compartment to place the Bolt receiver into when not in use. One of my old Logitech wireless mouse had a removable battery compartment which allowed you to place the receiver into when it wasn't in use and that was great. Now I can and have lost a few receivers because there's no place to put those tiny Unifying receivers.2.) No visible charge level indicator.Yes there is a charging indicator but it doesn't tell you the battery level/percentage without having to check the software. The green light is simply on of off. I don't know what it looks like when there is a low battery (like if it turns red or anything) but I'd rather know the actual percentage just from glancing at the mouse instead of having to open up the software and constantly check. For example, three tiny lights to tell me if the battery is high, medium, or low. Notifying me only when it IS low on battery is literally waiting until the last minute to let me know before I have to charge it which isn't a plus exactly.3.) Ambidextrous it is not.I'm not left handed or ambidextrous but I really would have liked to have seen an ambidextrous version of the MX Master series from Logitech.4.) You can use it even when it's charging (looking at you Apple and Sony).I hate not being able to use my devices when they're charging especially because I don't like to plus in my devices to let them charge (and then overcharge) overnight. I'm glad Logitech didn't try to reinvent the wheel just to look sleeker and dumber like Apple's pathetic (not so) Magic mouse.5.) No USB-C receiver.I switch between a desktop using Windows and a MacBook Air. The Windows desktop uses the Bolt receiver and the MacBook Air uses Bluetooth. The Bluetooth use for this 3S mouse is a little laggy on my MacBook Air but I don't mind it much since I code as a hobby. My Windows desktop is my main computer. I don't have a Bolt receiver for my MacBook Air yet but that's because I'm a.) waiting to see if Logitech gives us a Bolt receiver with USB-C and b.) I don't have a docking station/hub yet to use with my MacBook Air anyway (and the MacBook Air I have only has USB-C ports). The reason why this isn't a con or a pro is because my Windows desktop doesn't have any USB-C ports to begin with because of COVID and the chip shortage with those eye-watering prices for computer components. Otherwise I would have built a new desktop computer by now.I don't know if Logitech even reads these reviews but I really hope the next iteration isn't worse. It's becoming increasingly more difficult to find tech you like to use only to not be able to find a replacement down the road because the series was discontinued or has been ""upgraded"" by a manufacturer. Either way though, I'm glad we have the 3S. I can certainly imagine a much worse product/world if we didn't have the 3S. Things could have been worse with the 3S but thankfully they're not world-changing bad at least for me.

I've been using the Logitech Performance MX or MX Master mouse for years now. I've tried a few other types of mice (expensive, performance-type) and I always return to this one. I love it!When I had problems with severe carpal tunnel in both hands 1-1/2 yrs ago, I tried various ergonomic-style mice while I was waiting for surgery, and I still went back to using this mouse - even while I was dealing with carpal tunnel.My favorite feature is the speed scrolling. There's a button you can use to change the scrolling setting from the standard 3-lines to speed scrolling (it just freely scrolls, no clicking). This is the primary reason I use this mouse. I build websites for a living and I must have a mouse that works for me, is dependable and fast, and this one fits the bill.The charge will last for days, and I use my mouse all day long 5 days a week, plus some usage on weekends. If the battery runs out while I'm working because I forgot to charge it overnight, I just have the charger plugged into my desktop tower so I can just plug it into my mouse and keep working. The cord is a bit annoying - but it's my own fault I didn't charge overnight.Will last for years, but no electronic device is indestructible - and I am hard on my mouse due to the amount of work I do. When I start to notice that the precision isn't as good or a slight ""stuttering"" while dragging, then I order whatever the new version is that's available.I hope Logitech never does away with this mouse as I will continue to use it for as long as I use a computer. I even have a separate mouse for my laptop as I do not like touch pads, especially for website and graphic work. There is a setting on the bottom of the mouse which allows you to change the ""channel"" so you can pair the same mouse with multiple devices. So, technically, I can use the same mouse for both my desktop and laptop. I just prefer having separate mice for my computers so I never have to worry about misplacing it or forgetting it. I just leave one in my laptop bag (I only use my laptop when I am traveling, or anywhere outside the house - otherwise, I always use my desktop when I'm at home).It is expensive for a computer mouse, but absolutely worth every cent.

I've grown up with Logitech gaming peripherals. Up until recently I was still using gaming mice and keyboards for work. But, I work from home in IT and was sick of looking at wires from my audacious dual cabled RGB mech keyboard and mouse that looks straight out of tron. I was even sick of managing colors on the myriad of things glowing, breathing, and pulsing light. Sometimes we need a change of scenery in life.The MX Master Series is Logitech all grown up at its best. The wireless works wonderfully, the battery life is amazing, and the ability to swap between controlling up to 3 devices is a delight. One charge lasts literal days of consistent use, so wires stay off my desk most of the time.This mouse specifically is exciting in ways I'm ashamed to admit. Rather than being hype on mouse for headshots, I was tickled at the buttery scroll wheel for scrolling long excel files. Imagine my joy when I realized it has an equally buttery horizontal scroll wheel. Oh yeah baby - from A to AAA with a flick of my thumb. As for the device swapping, pairing to laptop and desktop was a breeze and I can switch on the fly so fast I can stop my laptop from locking.Ergonomic feel is great, precision is great. This is not a gaming mouse, though. This is a business mouse, and it's comfortable with that.

This is the third time I've purchased this model of mouse and have now had a Gen1, Gen2 and Gen3. The last mouse was lost on a business trip so I replaced that one with the newest model. This generation has all the same basic features, I particularly like the redesign on buttons 4 and 5 which have a new feel and are easier to use, since on previous Gens those buttons were too close to each other.This is the first generation with USB-C which is much appreciated and long overdue. However, I did need to install new Logitech software to configure it, which had a terrible out-of-the-box configuration (I had to turn off the app specific configurations as Logitech was using a different set of buttons for each app, a neat feature but heavy-handed for it to be on by default.)Since I have other Logitech devices I'm now forced use Logitech Unifying, Logitech G-Hub, Logitech Options, Logitech Options+ and Logitech Bolt if I want to get the most out of the ""Logitech suite"".Finally, this comes shipped with a Logitech Bolt dongle instead of a Unifying Dongle, which is very similar to the Unifying dongle but is supposedly encrypted. It's still compatible with Unifying dongles.

I've never spent $99 for a mouse, but after reading the reviews on several design websites, I decided to try the Logitech MX3S knowing I had 30 days to return it if it didn't live up to my high expectations.It is incredibly customizable to the point that the features of this mouse have replaced my most-used keyboard shortcuts in Photoshop.  Copy/Paste, Brush size adjustment, Brush hardness adjustment, Zoom in and out, I even made a preset for a 1 click UNDO.  Talk about a productivity game-changer, this is it. A one-handed click or a scroll has replaced several finger dances. Saving time and significantly increased my productivity.I want to be careful to say it's not just for Photoshop, I have it programmed (easy setup) to do incredible things in Chrome too for faster more agile web browsing. Also programmed for Excel and even Windows itself.  I use it with Windows, but it's also Mac-compatible if that's your setup.If you use your computer to make money, then it's a no-brainer, you'll make up the purchase price in a day because of increased productivity. Additionally, the ergonomics will potentially save you a ton of money in avoiding carpal tunnel surgery. It's just so comfortable for long hours at the computer.It's 8K or 8000 dpi resolution meaning it can be set to be extremely sensitive, so sensitive it will even work on glass!  I have it set to 2400 dpi for my needs.  I'm not a gamer, but the 8K should be plenty enough to give you a speed advantage if that's what you're buying it for.In closing, if you need a new mouse and the investment could be worth it to you for any of the reasons I mentioned, then I urge you to at least give it a try for 30 days. If you don't love it, send it back.I hope this helps.

This mouse is definitely my favorite one to date. It's not perfect, but it's the closest I've come so far to finding one that is. The ""MagSpeed Electromagnetic Scrolling"" is one of my favorite features. I like that it can easily go between ratcheting and free spin without having to click the button. That being said, when doing quick scrolling, not in free spin, the scroll is a bit choppy and more difficult to control than other mice I've used. The rest of the features do more than make up for it though.The silent clicks is pretty awesome....granted it's not something particularly important to me, especially considering I'm using a mechanical keyboard. If you want a quiet mouse though, this is it! The fact that everything on the mouse is programable, and even can be programmed on a per app basis, makes this mouse take the cake in productivity.It's also pretty comfortable to use, so that doesn't suck. If you have small hands, this probably isn't gonna be the mouse for you, though. Even with my very medium hands, the mouse is on the taller side. I'm considering getting a wrist wrest to pair with it.I haven't used Logi Flow yet, but that will be coming up within the next month or so, and it's a feature I'm looking forward to using.Overall, this is a great mouse and I highly recommend it if you are looking for a productivity mouse. Gaming, not so much....but it's not marketed as a gaming mouse.

I work from home and have my personal computer set up right next to my work system. For the past 2 years I've been just switching between two mice and this has totally eliminated the switch. Both monitors are kept right next to each other so I would frequently try to use my PC mouse on my work mac and—of course—it didn't work. Well now it freaking does!!!! The setup was pretty easy and the switching—while not instant—is pretty dang fast... Honestly super impressive that a mouse that can switch between PC and mac with one second of derp while it swaps modes. I LOVE that the Options+ software keeps the clipboards shared too. Now I can share images and files without having to put them on a shared drive or something.The mouse itself is great too. Logitech makes great products hands down and the quality of this hardware is exactly what I would come to expect from the company. Signal dropouts are nonexistent, ergonomics are comfortable for frequent daily use, and I absolutely love the way it looks. All the buttons are super intuitive and really help productivity. The gestures are amazing and work across platforms wonderfully.Its nice being able to consolidate hardware too. Keeps desk clutter minimized.Overall, I am super happy with this device!

Pros:Scrolling 5/5-Scrolling on Windows has always be light years behind Mac - even when using a track pad on Windows vs a stepped scroll wheel, the scroll feels jerky and inconsistent while Macs always feel buttery smooth and fluid no matter what device you use. This mouse with the scroll wheel in free spin ""MagSpeed"" mode is the closest I've ever felt a Windows machine scroll like a Mac. It really is super nice. I almost never put it into the stepped mode. I see a lot of comments talking about inconsistent scrolling on this mouse and I cannot say I have experienced that. For context I am using the Lightspeed connector and not Bluetooth, which I'm sure plays a large factor with the free spin. Let's look at the math behind that. Logitech claims Lightspeed has a 1ms response time, while bluetooth can be as low as 34ms but is often times more around 100-300ms. In ""MagSpeed"" mode at full spin speed, this mouse will do 1000 lines per second. So yes, for your computer to ingest those line signals it's going to need a 1ms response rate. I am also using Logitech's Options+ software which may also play a role in scrolling stability.Ergonomics 4/5-Ergonomics feel really nice to me, but borderline too small. My glove size is between M and L (or 8 and 9), so if you are an L or larger hand maybe this won't work for you, but everyone's comfort is different. The thumb and palm sculpting is really nice and fills the hand nicely (depending on your size). The matte finish texturing also feels nice, I just hope it doesn't deteriorate over time.Logitech Options+ Software 5/5-Being able to program the button map per application is a game changer (for me) and has really improved my work flow. DPI can also be adjusted here.Gesture Button 5/5-The lower thumb ""gesture"" button gives back Mac like gestures to mouse users, something I sorta forgot I was missing but use it all the time now.DPI 5/5-I found out 8k DPI is too high for my monitor, which was one of the deciding factors for me between this and the MX 3. I have a 49inch ultrawide 32:9 ratio monitor at 5120X1440 resolution, and I could feel the lower DPI of my old mouse on this monitor. However this one set to 8k is crazy fast - way too fast - so I currently have it set to 55% speed. Again lets look at the math - if you have a 8k monitor, this mouse set to max DPI is going to get from the left most side of the screen to the right most side in just 1inch of mouse travel. That's fast - you may find that 8K is overkill for your needs. That said, this is all easily adjustable in the Options+ software and it does feel WAY smoother than any mouse or trackpad I've used. I've yet to use this on glass - I'm sure the DPI helps in that regard.Click 4/5-I honestly thought I wouldn't like having a silent click feel, and I like clicky keyboards as well, but it's growing on me. Enough so to make me rethink the type of keyboard I'm using. Click feel and sound ultimately comes down to preference, so all I can say is you feel the click, but it's barely audible. Search youtube or even Amazon reviews, I've seen sound comparisons with this mouse so judge for yourself.Cons:Ergonomics:-The lost point above is due to size - my fourth finger does rest on the desk, which was true of my previous mouse as well so I'm used to it but the experience would be better if there was a rest point or wing on the right side of this mouse. I don't know, this is again preference and hold style but for me I think I would have given a higher score for ergonomics if my pinky didn't touch the desk.Click:-Still on the fence on how silent the click is. Feel is good, sound is... well not there. So if you're used to a satisfying click sound this is going to be jarring.

I wish that there was a fusion between the Logitech G502 Hero wireless mouse, Logitech MX 3 mouse, and the ReDragon M801P Sniper Pro wireless mouse and the Razer Basilisk Ultimate. I don't understand why all other mice on the market do not have a hyper scroll capability yet. If the ReDragon M801P mouse had this hyper scroll wheel. I would love it because of the format of being able to wrest my ring finger on the mouse channel. It is so hard to find a good ergonomic mouse on the market today with great features.If that M801P ergonomic palm and finger wrest shape, as well as the scroll wheel placement and the RGB lighting was combined with the click ability of G502 Hero mouse buttons and button placement (including the middle finger length of the right mouse click). Was merged with the MX 3 mouse's perfected hyper scroll wheel, the thumb wheel functionality and programmability, as well as the ergonomic thumb rest shape, it would be the absolute perfect mouse! I totally had no idea how useful the thumbwheel would be until I started using. Its programmability makes it so useful!I found that with the functionality of the MX 3 Mouse, I am so much faster and enjoy doing the work now that I found tedious before. I get so much done; it is ridiculous! The combination of using this mouse with Logitech G915 keyboard makes me so much faster that I don't want to stop getting things done. I found that I can do stuff that I never could before typing wise with the G915. That is why I'm writing so much on this review. It doesn't even bother me at all since it doesn't take very long to do this. Work kind of feels like videogaming right now.Basically, the Razer Basilisk Ultimate has a RGB superior lighting capability as well as a better overall ergonomic shape feel than the G502 Hero. I had purchased it first and ended up returning it because the right click was missing clicks and the scroll wheel adjustment didn't reach the level of not ratcheting at all. The G502 simply had better clicking buttons and the hyper scroll wheel over the Basilisk Ultimate. Though the placement of the hyper scroll wheel forces one to shift their hand too much because its is to close to the second joint on the index finger. That is why I ended up returning the G502 and purchasing the MX 3 mouse.Recently I was forced to search for a new ergonomic wireless mouse.I previously had the original Logitech M705 portable mouse for around a decade. Finally wore it out to the point where the receiver would not connect. I loved the hyper scroll functionality of the mouse, as well as the ergonomics of thumb rest pocket curve. The forward and back buttons were a welcome addition, though I had to move my thumb far to reach them. The Issue with this mouse was that it was too small since it was meant for portability.When the original MX mouse came onto the market, I had no desire for it since the ergonomics and features were poor.Before purchasing this MX 3 Mouse I acquired the G502 Hero wireless and it was awesome except for the positioning of the scroll wheel, the thumb rest curvature, the coating on the mouse caused me to sweat and the mouse would slip in my hand, and finally the width of the mouse was too small for properly wresting one’s hand on. The MX 3 mouse wheel without the rubber grip is way better for feel and longevity over the G502 Hero wireless. The rubber on my original M705 mouse had worn loose after about a year or two of use and I had to cut it off in order to continue using the hyper scroll functionality. The G502 has a rubber on it which probably means it will loosen over time.The bad thing about the MX 3 mouse is that the forward and back buttons are small cheap plastic buttons that are difficult to press, unlike the G502 buttons. The hump that is put into the palm wrest behind the thumb wheel is just overkill and bad ergonomics. You end up having a hard surface jutting into the root bone socket of your index finger. The curvature of the M801P is much more conducive to the natural ergonomic flow of the palm.The right and left mouse click buttons on the MX 3 mouse are too loud and put up too much resistance. The right click's size is too narrow to allow for clicking all the time without running into the outer border of the mouse. The G502 had the perfect balance of size, shape and reactivity in comparison to the MX 3 mouse. A major issue I run into with the MX 3 mouse is that my index will accidentally brush ever so slightly against the hyper scroll wheel when it is on infinite scroll, and I am trying to rotate the thumb wheel while navigating an image gallery. This causes the gallery to start moving based on the infinite scroll.This issue could be avoided if the MX 3 mouse had finger channels like the G502, or the Razer Basilisk or even the M801P has. Though the M801P's right click is not as long and therefore it is possible for one's finger to slip over the end of it.I hope in the future Logitech, Razer, or ReDragon will implement the changes that I mentioned here and make the perfect mouse that could be used for either gaming or productivity.

I've been using this mouse for a year and I have to say, it has exceeded my expectations. The ergonomic design is comfortable to use for long periods of time and the ultrafast scrolling feature has made navigating through documents and websites a breeze. The customization options are also a great bonus, allowing me to tailor the mouse to my specific needs. The USB-C, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity options make it easy to use with a variety of devices.First of all, the ergonomic design is top-notch. The shape of the mouse fits comfortably in my hand and the thumb rest and gesture button allow me to use the mouse without straining my hand or wrist. This is especially important for me as I tend to use a mouse for long periods of time and have experienced discomfort with other models in the past. The Logitech MX Master 3 has completely eliminated that issue for me.The ultrafast scrolling feature is also a game-changer. I frequently have to scroll through long documents and websites, and the smooth and precise scrolling on the MX Master 3 makes that task much easier and more efficient. It's a small detail, but it has made a big difference in my daily workflow.The customization options are also a great feature. I was able to program the buttons to perform specific actions that I use frequently, such as copying and pasting or opening my email. This has saved me a lot of time and effort as I no longer have to navigate through menus or use keyboard shortcuts to perform these tasks.One of the standout features of the Logitech MX Master 3 is the Flow cross-computer control. This allows you to use the mouse to seamlessly control multiple computers at the same time. You can even copy and paste files and text between the computers, which is a huge time-saver.To use the Flow feature, you simply need to install the Logitech Options software on each of the computers you want to connect. From there, you can easily switch between the computers using the mouse and keyboard, as if you were using just one device. I've found the Flow feature to be extremely useful in my work as it allows me to easily move between multiple projects without having to constantly switch between devices. It's a unique and innovative feature that sets the MX Master 3 apart from other mice on the market.Some potential concerns: -Price on the higher end -Not left-hand friendly -Size not for smaller hands -Scroll wheel may be too smooth for someOverall, the Logitech MX Master 3 is a fantastic mouse that has greatly improved my productivity and comfort while using a computer. It's a high-quality product that I would highly recommend to anyone in need of a reliable and comfortable wireless mouse.

Pros:1.) The fact that the scroll wheel is all metal or at least gets rid of the stepped plastic insert from the 2S.Cleaning that part of the mouse was a minor quibble on the 2S nonetheless. Either way, the all metal scroll wheel feels a lot better to use now that it's all metal and the actual groves in the wheel feel much better to touch.2.) The silent clicks on the right and left clicker are a positive in my mind.3.) USB-C is a plus.Charging is faster although I didn't bother to time the exact difference between the 3S and my 2S. Future-proofing is a good thing given that the future is USB-C4.) Bigger horizontal scroll wheel with a caveat though (see con#1).No plastic grippy insert for the the horizonal scroll wheel on the 3S which is a pro or a con depending on how you use the horizonal scroll wheel. I didn't mind it either way on the 2S and not having it on the 3S is the same for me.Cons:1.) Logitech moved the dedicated side buttons lower and placed the horizontal scroll wheel above the dedicated side buttons.That means my thumb is constantly touching the lower of the two buttons on the left side which is not my preference. Compared to the MX Master 2S, the 3S two side buttons are too close to my thumb now which means I accidentally click the (default) forward button on the 3S more than I ever have when I used the MX Master 2S.2.) The rubber or soft-touch plastic that surrounds where your palm goes is way too slippery for my taste.The MS Master 2S had a grippy soft outer rubber layer for the thumb and the palm which made it much easier to hold and grip. Unfortunately the MX Master 3S is very slippery and harder to grip. The MX Master 3S is definitely much easier to clean but holding the mouse requires me to use my pinky and right ring finger more often. Compared to when I used my Master MX 3S, I could easily and swiftly wander with the 3S using only my pinky and thumb to hold the right and left sides respectively.3.) Activation/press area of hidden thumb button is much smaller on the 3S compared to the larger area on the 2S.There's a little grove/pit that you press down on using your thumb with the 3S and it's much smaller than I would like. Not only is it smaller on the 3S, the position of the area/grove is too far behind where my thumb rests. I have to scrunch up my thumb to reach back on the mouse to click it which is annoying. The 2S had a much better placement and the entire area your thumb rest on was clickable. Yes, the 2S had that hard plastic edge that made it harder to clean and allowed things to get into which made it even harder to clean but since I always have clean hands it was never an issue for me with I used the 2S hidden thumb button.4.) The 3S has a smaller palm area.Depending on your preference, this is a con or a pro or both. For me, this is a con. I have small hands so I liked how much more bulkier the MX Master 2S was. The bulkier 2S was easier for me to hold because I didn't have to scrunch up my palm in order to make more contact with the palm rest. This also means less area for your palm to rest on which I do. If you don't rest your palm on the mouse as much, this won't be a con for you.Not a pro but not a con either:1.) No storage area for the Bolt receiver on the 3S anywhere just like the 2S unfortunately.I don't travel a lot so it's not a problem at the moment but I would have still liked to see a tiny compartment to place the Bolt receiver into when not in use. One of my old Logitech wireless mouse had a removable battery compartment which allowed you to place the receiver into when it wasn't in use and that was great. Now I can and have lost a few receivers because there's no place to put those tiny Unifying receivers.2.) No visible charge level indicator.Yes there is a charging indicator but it doesn't tell you the battery level/percentage without having to check the software. The green light is simply on of off. I don't know what it looks like when there is a low battery (like if it turns red or anything) but I'd rather know the actual percentage just from glancing at the mouse instead of having to open up the software and constantly check. For example, three tiny lights to tell me if the battery is high, medium, or low. Notifying me only when it IS low on battery is literally waiting until the last minute to let me know before I have to charge it which isn't a plus exactly.3.) Ambidextrous it is not.I'm not left handed or ambidextrous but I really would have liked to have seen an ambidextrous version of the MX Master series from Logitech.4.) You can use it even when it's charging (looking at you Apple and Sony).I hate not being able to use my devices when they're charging especially because I don't like to plus in my devices to let them charge (and then overcharge) overnight. I'm glad Logitech didn't try to reinvent the wheel just to look sleeker and dumber like Apple's pathetic (not so) Magic mouse.5.) No USB-C receiver.I switch between a desktop using Windows and a MacBook Air. The Windows desktop uses the Bolt receiver and the MacBook Air uses Bluetooth. The Bluetooth use for this 3S mouse is a little laggy on my MacBook Air but I don't mind it much since I code as a hobby. My Windows desktop is my main computer. I don't have a Bolt receiver for my MacBook Air yet but that's because I'm a.) waiting to see if Logitech gives us a Bolt receiver with USB-C and b.) I don't have a docking station/hub yet to use with my MacBook Air anyway (and the MacBook Air I have only has USB-C ports). The reason why this isn't a con or a pro is because my Windows desktop doesn't have any USB-C ports to begin with because of COVID and the chip shortage with those eye-watering prices for computer components. Otherwise I would have built a new desktop computer by now.I don't know if Logitech even reads these reviews but I really hope the next iteration isn't worse. It's becoming increasingly more difficult to find tech you like to use only to not be able to find a replacement down the road because the series was discontinued or has been ""upgraded"" by a manufacturer. Either way though, I'm glad we have the 3S. I can certainly imagine a much worse product/world if we didn't have the 3S. Things could have been worse with the 3S but thankfully they're not world-changing bad at least for me.

I've been using the Logitech Performance MX or MX Master mouse for years now. I've tried a few other types of mice (expensive, performance-type) and I always return to this one. I love it!When I had problems with severe carpal tunnel in both hands 1-1/2 yrs ago, I tried various ergonomic-style mice while I was waiting for surgery, and I still went back to using this mouse - even while I was dealing with carpal tunnel.My favorite feature is the speed scrolling. There's a button you can use to change the scrolling setting from the standard 3-lines to speed scrolling (it just freely scrolls, no clicking). This is the primary reason I use this mouse. I build websites for a living and I must have a mouse that works for me, is dependable and fast, and this one fits the bill.The charge will last for days, and I use my mouse all day long 5 days a week, plus some usage on weekends. If the battery runs out while I'm working because I forgot to charge it overnight, I just have the charger plugged into my desktop tower so I can just plug it into my mouse and keep working. The cord is a bit annoying - but it's my own fault I didn't charge overnight.Will last for years, but no electronic device is indestructible - and I am hard on my mouse due to the amount of work I do. When I start to notice that the precision isn't as good or a slight ""stuttering"" while dragging, then I order whatever the new version is that's available.I hope Logitech never does away with this mouse as I will continue to use it for as long as I use a computer. I even have a separate mouse for my laptop as I do not like touch pads, especially for website and graphic work. There is a setting on the bottom of the mouse which allows you to change the ""channel"" so you can pair the same mouse with multiple devices. So, technically, I can use the same mouse for both my desktop and laptop. I just prefer having separate mice for my computers so I never have to worry about misplacing it or forgetting it. I just leave one in my laptop bag (I only use my laptop when I am traveling, or anywhere outside the house - otherwise, I always use my desktop when I'm at home).It is expensive for a computer mouse, but absolutely worth every cent.

I've grown up with Logitech gaming peripherals. Up until recently I was still using gaming mice and keyboards for work. But, I work from home in IT and was sick of looking at wires from my audacious dual cabled RGB mech keyboard and mouse that looks straight out of tron. I was even sick of managing colors on the myriad of things glowing, breathing, and pulsing light. Sometimes we need a change of scenery in life.The MX Master Series is Logitech all grown up at its best. The wireless works wonderfully, the battery life is amazing, and the ability to swap between controlling up to 3 devices is a delight. One charge lasts literal days of consistent use, so wires stay off my desk most of the time.This mouse specifically is exciting in ways I'm ashamed to admit. Rather than being hype on mouse for headshots, I was tickled at the buttery scroll wheel for scrolling long excel files. Imagine my joy when I realized it has an equally buttery horizontal scroll wheel. Oh yeah baby - from A to AAA with a flick of my thumb. As for the device swapping, pairing to laptop and desktop was a breeze and I can switch on the fly so fast I can stop my laptop from locking.Ergonomic feel is great, precision is great. This is not a gaming mouse, though. This is a business mouse, and it's comfortable with that.

This is the third time I've purchased this model of mouse and have now had a Gen1, Gen2 and Gen3. The last mouse was lost on a business trip so I replaced that one with the newest model. This generation has all the same basic features, I particularly like the redesign on buttons 4 and 5 which have a new feel and are easier to use, since on previous Gens those buttons were too close to each other.This is the first generation with USB-C which is much appreciated and long overdue. However, I did need to install new Logitech software to configure it, which had a terrible out-of-the-box configuration (I had to turn off the app specific configurations as Logitech was using a different set of buttons for each app, a neat feature but heavy-handed for it to be on by default.)Since I have other Logitech devices I'm now forced use Logitech Unifying, Logitech G-Hub, Logitech Options, Logitech Options+ and Logitech Bolt if I want to get the most out of the ""Logitech suite"".Finally, this comes shipped with a Logitech Bolt dongle instead of a Unifying Dongle, which is very similar to the Unifying dongle but is supposedly encrypted. It's still compatible with Unifying dongles.

I've never spent $99 for a mouse, but after reading the reviews on several design websites, I decided to try the Logitech MX3S knowing I had 30 days to return it if it didn't live up to my high expectations.It is incredibly customizable to the point that the features of this mouse have replaced my most-used keyboard shortcuts in Photoshop.  Copy/Paste, Brush size adjustment, Brush hardness adjustment, Zoom in and out, I even made a preset for a 1 click UNDO.  Talk about a productivity game-changer, this is it. A one-handed click or a scroll has replaced several finger dances. Saving time and significantly increased my productivity.I want to be careful to say it's not just for Photoshop, I have it programmed (easy setup) to do incredible things in Chrome too for faster more agile web browsing. Also programmed for Excel and even Windows itself.  I use it with Windows, but it's also Mac-compatible if that's your setup.If you use your computer to make money, then it's a no-brainer, you'll make up the purchase price in a day because of increased productivity. Additionally, the ergonomics will potentially save you a ton of money in avoiding carpal tunnel surgery. It's just so comfortable for long hours at the computer.It's 8K or 8000 dpi resolution meaning it can be set to be extremely sensitive, so sensitive it will even work on glass!  I have it set to 2400 dpi for my needs.  I'm not a gamer, but the 8K should be plenty enough to give you a speed advantage if that's what you're buying it for.In closing, if you need a new mouse and the investment could be worth it to you for any of the reasons I mentioned, then I urge you to at least give it a try for 30 days. If you don't love it, send it back.I hope this helps.

This mouse is definitely my favorite one to date. It's not perfect, but it's the closest I've come so far to finding one that is. The ""MagSpeed Electromagnetic Scrolling"" is one of my favorite features. I like that it can easily go between ratcheting and free spin without having to click the button. That being said, when doing quick scrolling, not in free spin, the scroll is a bit choppy and more difficult to control than other mice I've used. The rest of the features do more than make up for it though.The silent clicks is pretty awesome....granted it's not something particularly important to me, especially considering I'm using a mechanical keyboard. If you want a quiet mouse though, this is it! The fact that everything on the mouse is programable, and even can be programmed on a per app basis, makes this mouse take the cake in productivity.It's also pretty comfortable to use, so that doesn't suck. If you have small hands, this probably isn't gonna be the mouse for you, though. Even with my very medium hands, the mouse is on the taller side. I'm considering getting a wrist wrest to pair with it.I haven't used Logi Flow yet, but that will be coming up within the next month or so, and it's a feature I'm looking forward to using.Overall, this is a great mouse and I highly recommend it if you are looking for a productivity mouse. Gaming, not so much....but it's not marketed as a gaming mouse.

I work from home and have my personal computer set up right next to my work system. For the past 2 years I've been just switching between two mice and this has totally eliminated the switch. Both monitors are kept right next to each other so I would frequently try to use my PC mouse on my work mac and—of course—it didn't work. Well now it freaking does!!!! The setup was pretty easy and the switching—while not instant—is pretty dang fast... Honestly super impressive that a mouse that can switch between PC and mac with one second of derp while it swaps modes. I LOVE that the Options+ software keeps the clipboards shared too. Now I can share images and files without having to put them on a shared drive or something.The mouse itself is great too. Logitech makes great products hands down and the quality of this hardware is exactly what I would come to expect from the company. Signal dropouts are nonexistent, ergonomics are comfortable for frequent daily use, and I absolutely love the way it looks. All the buttons are super intuitive and really help productivity. The gestures are amazing and work across platforms wonderfully.Its nice being able to consolidate hardware too. Keeps desk clutter minimized.Overall, I am super happy with this device!

UPDATED -I ordered this on the 6th of January and the software is update but this thing lags and is spotty. The scroll is inconsistent and it disconnects constantly. I had to unplug my unifier for the bolt and download the logitech + and I am done. This thing frustrates me more than it helps me.I did some google searches and it seems as this is a common issue with this mouse. I decided to move my lap top and USB receiver is to my right where the mouse resides. So far I have not had any more issues.**I had to replace my Logitech M720, I have used this model for YEARS. For some reason in the last few weeks it really started to get very spotty and hard for me to use. I ordered a new one, same type and same issue. I worked with my IT and and we reset it, and all the stuff and it still acted spotty and stuck. Recommendation was to replace it with another model.When I went to use this MX Master 3, I didn't realize I had to charge it, it seemed to have a charge but I wanted it to be charged fully. After it charged, I realized it is not a plug and play exactly. I use a Logitech unifier software and this one had me download new Logi Options + and use the USB that came with it. I plugged the USB to my Adapter and it was really spotty too! I did use the Logi Options + help and it told me to plug it into the my lap top. This is fine EXCEPT I only have one port on it. I had to Bluetooth my Logitech keyboard because the unifier was useless.It took a minute to get it all working correctly, but since then I do love it. Smooth operation and quiet. The scroll is seamless and it works really well.

Probably the best mouse I've ever owned. The macros are customizable on MacOS and Windows. For someone who hates track balls, the second scroll wheel is a game changer when working with spreadsheets. I'm not sure I'd recommend this mouse for gaming as I haven't used it for that purpose, but I've never had any issues with tracking on mouse pads or desk surfaces. My only wish is that the angle was a bit more steep to help the ergonomics.

I've been using Master Mx mouse since they were first released and never had any issues with the unifying receiver, but  the new Bolt Receiver is very laggy unless the receiver is plugged directly into computer and the computer is next to the mouse.I have my laptop/docking station on the left side of my workstation and when the Bolt Receiver is plugged into the docking station the mouse movement is laggy/floaty  (I don't game with it, just normal business apps).  To resolve I had to get an 2ft USB extension and placed the Bolt Receiver directly in front of the mouse.While traveling, when the Bolt Receiver was plugged into a port replicator, the mouse also became laggy.  I had to plug the extension cable directly to the laptop to resolve.As others have mentioned, the mouse clicking doesn't have very much tactile feedback, but you get used to it right away.

Looking for a mouse? Debating on this one or another one? Don't bother. This one is the winner.1. Ergonomic - it's ergonomic AF. My hand is super comfortable on it all day at the computer - for reference I do Revit and AutoCAD along with other design programs that requires heavy use of the mouse. I'm not a gamer but I think the same principles apply (or maybe they don't lol).2. Quiet - I never thought I'd ever care about my mouse being quiet. Well, now I can't go back. The clicks are soft and quiet but it still ""clicks"" in an extremely satisfying manner where you know you clicked on something. The top scroll and side scroll - AMAZING. They are made out of metal which gives it a lovely, heavier weight to them than any other mouse I've used. They both scroll softly and smoothly. The way they feel under your fingers is chef's kiss.3. Customization - you can also customize how you want the clicks and the scrolls to work. This gives me the opportunity to customize the mouse in a way that is perfect for me. Love that the two buttons near my thumb can be copy and paste because I do a lot of that.4. Bluetooth - This is where I had to knock off a star. The bluetooth connection for this mouse was very spotty for me. I don't know if I got a defective mouse but the bluetooth connection would not hold after the computer and the mouse would go to sleep. I had to manually reconnect the mouse to the computer but eventually, even that stopped working. I am currently using the usb and this has worked great.Overall, I would still recommend this mouse 100% because of its functionality and design. I can't over emphasize how wonderfully quiet this mouse is but still satisfying to use. I swear you will never want to go back to a loud clicky mouse ever again. Maybe you won't have the bluetooth issue but again, since they give you the usb backup method, I can still use the mouse with no issues.

My first ever mouse purchase was a laser mouse from Logitech in the early 2000s to replace the family ball mouse. I'm fairly certain my parents still use it to this day.The point of me mentioning this is that, in my experience, Logitech products (particularly mice) have been durable and functional. Fast forward to 2020 when I was looking for an ergonomic mouse that would save my wrist from the pain of being on a computer all day nearly every day, for work and personal use. I also wanted the mouse to support macOS gestures since I'm a frequent user of them for work. I decided to purchase the Logitech MX Master 3 as it appeared to fit these requirements.I've now had this mouse for 2 years and I've traveled with it across the country working from different locations and setups. I've also accidentally dropped this mouse on the hardwood floor probably 20+ times over the last year (I'm getting used to a new under-desk slide-out keyboard/mouse tray where the mouse lays very close to the edge). Despite two years of all-day, every (work) day use and dozens of ~2 foot drops onto a hard surface, this mouse is still going just as strong today as it was 2 years ago.The metal scroll wheels (vertical + horizontal) are both very smooth and responsive. The button placement is comfortable (back, forward, left, right). The Bluetooth connection to my MacBook Pro works without any lag, and shows battery charge percentage in my Mac's menu bar. The gesture button (beneath the thumb) is comfortable and very functional - I have it set so that a simple click shows all my windows (mission control), holding it and moving the mouse slightly up reveals my desktop, and holding it and moving the mouse slightly down shows all my current app windows (app expose). All the buttons and sensitivity are easily adjusted via the Logi Options app. The battery lasts many weeks before needing a charge, and charges fast via USB-C.I highly recommend this mouse.

Let's get this out of the way; this is NOT a mouse designed for gaming. However, it covers this area well enough, for the average/casual gamer. It is heavier than most mice (and gaming mice), and doesn't have the higher dpi that most gaming mice have.That said, if you need a mouse for everything else, absolutely nothing else comes close!Do you know what I love holding in my hands? No, not that. My woman! I love holding my woman in my hands. She fits in my hands perfectly. Oh how I love her... I say all of that to say, I love holding this mouse more! Holding this mouse is orgasmic. But seriously though, it has perfect ergonomics. It is slightly more upright than most mice, but nowhere near to vertical mice. Some people may love that, others may dislike it, and others may not care. Personally, I love it. There's a little bit of pinky-finger drag, but that's common in most mice.It's made for bigger hands, so if your hands are very small, you may have difficulty holding it *is what I told her ;)*Design and Build -This thing is built beautifully, and the colour (matte grey) is nice. The soft touch material is comfortable, and doesn't collect/trap much dust. A simple wipe with the palm of your hand is enough to clean it off. The metal scroll wheels feel so much better than plastic ones. In fact, going back to a mouse with plastic wheels is like going back to your ex if you're still bitter with her (I won't recommend it).Accessories -It comes well packaged, and includes the pairing dongle, and a matching USB-C cable for charging. Thankfully, the charging port is to the front, so you can use the mouse while it's charging (looking at you Apple!).Speaking of charging, this thing charges incredibly quickly. I mean, three hrs of usage only after a few mins of charging is out of this world!Speaking of ""out of this world"", let's discussion functionality -On its own, the MX Master 3 is superb. But with Logitech's software, this thing is godly! The functionality and customizablility is second to none. If you have a specific idea of how you'd like to use this mouse with your PC and suit of programs, then almost anything is possible. You can even customize different functions for different programs, as well as have universal settings for general use. And speaking of ""godly""; that magscroll wheel is just that. They say you can scroll through 1000 lines of code in seconds, and that is no exaggeration. Scrolling normally puts you in ratchet mode (where you feel the ""click"", through every line), and with a quick swipe of the finger, it goes into ""smooth scrolling"", where it can literally scroll nonstop for about 10 to 12 seconds.I have this mouse (along with the MX Keys) paired with my laptop and I can easily switch between my desktop and laptop, without any cords or extra dingles. Literally, dragging my mouse cursor over to the laptop screen is all I have to do. I can have entertainment on one screen, and productivity on another. I'm even able to transfer files between the two systems, by simply copying from one system, dragging the cursor over to the other system and pasting. It really is that simple, though I rarely have a need for such functionality. But, it's there if I want it.PS - The knobs feel great and are positioned ideally for ergonomics.The only things that you may need to take into consideration are 1) It's for right-handed people only. And 2) If you're accustomed to very light mice, it may take you a while to get accustomed the added weight.

I cannot comment on the value of this mouse as I got it through work.Very nice mouse, the rubbery texture feels nice and the ergonomics is great (assuming you are right handed). The scroll wheel has hyperscrolling, which allows you to unlock it for free spin, but also automatically free spins when you spin it fast enough. Love it, though it isn't super useful. There is a programmable thumb button, though it is a little awkward to press.Logitech has software for this mouse being Logitech Options+, where you can reprogram the buttons either in general or per application. I find it not worthwhile and buggy, as the profiles would bleed into each other, causing me to use the wrong macros.

This mouse is not cheap but is well made and works very well. I've tested with both the include Logi Bolt receiver as well as via bluetooth, and on both macOS Ventura as well as Windows 10. No issues whatsoever, nice that it is charged with a USB-C cable.

SUMMARY: I bought the 3s for the quiet clicks. It is pretty much silent... now I feel like my laptop keyboard is loud ha!PROS: The new Logi Options + app has a clean UI, it's easy to navigate and modify settings. Mouse functions well, the sensor tracks great on all the surfaces I've used it on. I use 1600 DPI. Smooth scroll functionality and the mag wheel are good as usual. Battery life rocks even on Bluetooth connection, and the 3s charges via USB C.CONS: Smaller than the first gen Master. The 3s leaves a bit less space for my pinkie finger, but this may be something that just takes time to get used to. The middle wheel on the first gen had soft rubber texturing which is missing on the 3s - makes me have a nails-on-chalkboard sensory experience when I first touch the well. Last pitfall - the thumb gesture button feels mushy and requires too much pressure to operate in a smooth workflow imo.

Fits really well into my hand, much less strain than the mouse that came with my PC.I love the extra buttons but they need to have more options that what is currently allowed. The left scroll does not go left to right on my on-screen take-off software, it's just another zoom, that only goes out but not in---so kind of a bummer. ---Dear Logitech, can this issue be fixed in an update?Having a dedicated copy/paste buttons is a game changer though!Otherwise, the best part is the quiet clicks - drove me batty to hear all the click, click, clicking noise all day long.I do have concerns that the battery did not fully charge to 100%, only got to 90% with it plugged in all night.  Based on my first day of usage, I used 5% of the battery today. So it should last pretty long between charges. But I am wondering why it did not fully charge?Overall very nice mouse, big improvement from a basic one, but it does need a few tweaks/updates to make it 5 star worthy imho.

Fits the hand well and helped increase productivity with the gestures feature.  Bluetooth works great.  No dongle needed.

The 'app specific' feature is really nice BUT...If the respective app is open then the other features will not work.For example... I use the thumb button in a custom manner so that I push down and swipe the mouse to open pages and tools that I set up.But when I have any of the apps open that I set for specific features, the swipe function is gone until I close the app.Not even swiping it on the second monitor, or outside the app window, will allow the features to come back... ONLY closing the app will then bring back the common features I set.The app specific feature ability is AWESOME other than that. I do a lot of photoshop and MS Office and those features would be awesome to use. I have turned them off though because of the above.Maybe an update to the software?I have MX Master previous editions on each of my 3 office PCs and my PC at home.The placement of the thumb wheel on this new one makes me have to lift my thumb to operate it but I got used to the wheel just being right there with the MX regulars. I use the thumb wheel for volume because I have to turn it up and down often depending on what clients are in the office and where. Yes, I know... boo hoo I have to lift my thumb... but comfort and seamless operation is what we spend the extra money for.The thumb button is further back on the mouse than the previous ones as well, so I am having to pull my thumb back to use it where as before I didn't have to.So with this mouse I am having to manipulate my thumb where before I barely had to move it at all.It's not a deal killer ... but if I had to do it again, I'd wait for the next gen.The scroll wheel is awesome. Much smoother and the tactile feedback is much nicer if you can imagine, almost as if it's the vibrating haptic feedback on a smart-phone. Really nice and silent.All in all it's as nice as the ones before it but not as ergonomic in my opinion... for my hand anyway.I'm sending it back for a replacement because the I could juuust barely feel it click when I left click and most of the time not at all, and that drives me crazy. Almost feels like it's not doing anything. I have grown to like, and even depend on the haptics and also the sound of the click on a mouse.*** Got the new one now and the click is perfect***The right click is fine.Some people actually will get silent ones intentionally but they still want to feel it click.A 'dead' click might sound stupid but it would be a deal breaker with me.My overall recommendation:If you have been an MX Master user for a while already I'd wait for the next gen MX Master and hope the placement of the thumb wheel and thumb button is back better and that the apps will allow the stock functions to work at the same time.If you have never used an MX Master then you will LOVE this mouse and it's worth every penny.

Even at $100, i bought a 2nd for a friend.  It's a nice gift because it's the kind of think most people couldn't stand spending that kind of money on for themselves, but will really love how much better it is to use than a standard/cheap one.  It's comfy, not too cluttered with buttons, the horizontal scroll is pretty nice actually, and i definitely have used the app over time, to customize a few buttons for some apps, which is very nice.  (Clicking the mouse wheel to open a new explored window with Ctrl+N is quite nice now that i'm used to it.)I also do use the switch on the bottom between multiple computers, it's a useful feature you might not think about (though... alas, as much as i tried to reprogram the switch to one of the top buttons, it's not possible).The scroll wheel is also very nice and once you get used to it you will probably be slightly bothered using other less solid feeling ones.  All around just a high quality daily driver that i've used for at least a year now and am really glad i went a little extra for a product that is actually high quality.(also... i told myself i needed to post a positive review since i just trashed another horrible purchase and am worried about the ""negative feedback"" bias, so this was the maybe the most approved thing in my history i picked.)

First, this is not a gaming mouse... yes logitech is known for gaming gear, but that isn't the purpose of this mouse.  It's made for designers like me.  It has a precision level that is virtually unparalleled and a responsiveness that is amazing.  Sure, you could probably play some casual games with it, but action and fps type games are out.  This mouse can pair with up to 3 systems and has all the functions that I want for designing in SolidWorks or Fusion 360 and seems to have pretty amazing battery life.  Using the logibolt + software I can customize the functions depending on if I'm doing CAD design or using Photoshop or Illustrator.  For what I use it for I can easily give it a 5 out of 5.

Stellar mouse, not much to say negatively. Overtime the thumb pad gets discolored on the white/grey mouse, but not the worst thing. Otherwise, connectivity is easy, responsiveness is lightning fast, and switching between up-to-3 devices (Mac, PC, PC for me) + is really essential and works as expected.

Love it and converted a few friends. Biggest gripe is that the device switching button is on the bottom and can't be remapped somewhere else.

I purchased this mouse for professional use; after seeing pictures of it on Reddit, and then reading tons of positive reviews. I had been using gaming-style mice previously. This mouse looks very professional and is designed for power users. My use case is primarily Solidworks, Adobe Acrobat, MS excel & word, and Microsoft Dynamics GP; and am in front of the computer 6-8 hours a day typically so I want a mouse that is comfortable and efficient.Ergonomically, I find the mouse to be fairly comfortable, but not perfect. I have Smedium hand size, and my mouse grip is something between claw and palm grip. My pinky is a bit uncomfortable so far, but I am still getting adjusted to the new mouse. I have found my thumb reaching too far back and high for the ""back"" button, but again, i think this is just a matter of getting used to the mouse. The gesture button (on thumb rest) is a bit tricky/awkward to click, and I dont think I will really use the gesture feature so i programmed this button to toggle the scroll wheel between ratchet and freespin mode. The mouse has a nice rubberized texture, but Im sure this will wear in time...we will see. It has a good weight too it, feels solid, but some people may prefer lighterweight mice.The buttons are nice and clicky, good tactile and audible feedback. 7 total buttons. It has the two primary mouse buttons, the scroll wheel can be clicked, a small button directly behind the scroll wheel, two buttons on the side of the mouse (forward, back), and then a button on the bottom edge of the thumb rest.Alright can we talk about the main scroll wheel now? Im obsessed with this wheel. First, it looks awesome. No plastic, 100% Machined steel. Second, it scrolls like nothing else Ive ever experienced. I leave it in ""ratchet"" mode most of the time, but it can also switch to free-spin. In ratchet mode, if you flick it, it will freespin. And with the Logitech Options software you can dial it in to be just how you like it. Electromagnets, Baby! I find myself just flicking the wheel sometimes because it feels so nice.All of the buttons are fully customizable using the Logitech Options software, and can have specific functions depending on what app you are in. The downside, is if your work computer is locked down by the company and you cant install this software, I think you will be stuck with the default functions which may not be enjoyable (in particular I found the default pointer speed way too slow).This mouse can connect to your computer via bluetooth or the Logitech Unity USB dongle, and can be paired with up to 3 computers (toggle between them using the button  on the bottom of the mouse).I ordered the mouse in ""Graphite"" which is the dark but definitely not black. It would be nice if they offered a color that is a darker, more true ""black."" Still, its a nice looking mouse, especially with the shiny steel scroll wheel.

I’m a photographer and graphic designer who uses the Adobe suite of products on Mac and I’ve been using this mouse for about four months now. This mouse is a fantastic replacement for the stock Apple mouse and may just be my favorite device ever. Yes the price tag is steep, however it is worth almost every single penny.First, Logitech provide a software download to use with the mouse which allows you to program the multiple buttons however you wish. What I want to emphasize is that you can have different settings for multiple apps and it fluidly switches back and forth without hesitation. Dream come true!Second, the battery life is amazing! Only had to charge it once so far!Third, the ergonomics of the mouse are to die for. Best ergonomic mouse I’ve ever used.The only issue, I’ve faced is Bluetooth connectivity, however it’s not enough of an issue to turn me away from this mouse. I use the little USB receiver, which annoys me a little but again not enough to shadow how awesome this mouse is. Additionally apple products, in my experiences with them at least, don’t always interact well with third party Bluetooth devices. This may be a factor however I’m not 100% sure.

I have to say this is one of my favorite tech purchases so far. I've only used mac mouses before picking this up and I'm glad for the upgrade, well worth it, except the finish is starting to turn after less than a week of use.Full disclosure: I requested a replacement, but I'm positive this is inevitable and will happen again. So a warning for those who are trying to achieve a certain aesthetic that matches their desk.It seems it's common for discoloration to occur in lighter colors.I had no problems connecting the mouse to my computers and charging the mouse was lightning fast. I have average size hands so it fits comfortably for me.I wish this mouse was able to pair with other softwares so I can customize button actions. Otherwise I really like the horizontal scroll and find it handy.One thing to mention: I work a lot in design software and don't feel the horizontal scroll is all that helpful when panning or moving around artboards.Example: Mac Mouse I have an easy time scrolling across artboards by using the mouse to swipe, but I seem to lack this functionality with the MX and often have to use the space bar to move around artboards (not used to this at all). I have to utilize the grab tool more than I'd like and I actually find this kind of annoying and slows down my workflow until now I haven't figured out another method to scroll and pan easily across an artboard.

My wife ""stole"" my old one and so I had to get this updated version. Don't feel much difference in daily use, which is good. For my hand, it feels great and in general just works.One thing though: I hate the ""quick scroll"" feature. I don't want to take away a star for this, but would rate 4.5 just because this automatic quick scroll is annoying as hell when it kicks in.

 The top scroll wheel is sleek, I really like it, it spins freely when you give it enough beans and has a threshold where it stops itself. Build overall seems really solid and the buttons are well placed. I only wish the right side had more of a grove to make lifting the mouse easier.

An excellent wireless PC mouse that really performs as Logitech's claims, but the price point is quite high. The rechargeable battery last much longer than previous models even for everyday heavy uses. The associated software Logi Option+ provides innovative features, but it lacks Linux support. A big disappointment.

Much quieter than the MX Master 2 I used before, with a better placement of back and forward buttons.Logitech software is not necessary but if you're running Linux, check Solaar on GitHub if you want a few more options.

1:  I needed to return the 1st and get a second. The 1st wouldn't hold a charge at all.2: You can switch devices, up to 3 of them... but in order to do that, you need to puck the mouse up and click on a button on the bottom is it.... while, I feel lazy writing this and ""complaining"" about it...... Ease of Function would allow for me to click perhaps on the right side with my pinky to switch... or, the left side thumb rest area.... I don't want to pick it up, I want to seemlessly switch between devices.

I had the MX Master 2S in gray and it was fantastic.  I traveled everywhere with it in my laptop bag and would switch it to my computer seamlessly at home with the switch on the bottom.  Having Bluetooth connectivity is great.Never buy the white one.  It was what Amazon had in stock, so I bought it because I wanted the upgraded USB C charging and didn't want to carry around more cables with my laptop.  One cable to rule them all and in the bag, bind them.Needless to say, the white non-slip grip on the outside of the mouse is a MAGNET for hand grease.  I am constantly wiping the thing down but I can already see where the white is starting to get a little gross brown tint to it even with Clorox wipes going at it pretty regularly.TL/DR, Great mouse, don't get the white one.

It fits my hand very comfortable, and works very smoothly.  The buttons feel good and smooth.  I don't notice any mis-clicks.  I love the thumb scroll wheel. I programmed it to volume control and it's so nice.The only think I complain about, and it is a big annoyance for me is the sleep mode.  My old mouse, I could move it or click the button and wake up the entire computer instantly.  This one, I have to use the keyboard to wake the computer.  Once the screen comes up, it can take up to 30 seconds for the mouse to wake up and start working.  I don't see how that was acceptable for them to release it that way.  I've had many other mouse that woke up instantly, so I don't understand why this one can't.But other than that one BIG complaint, it's great.

Background - I purchased this mouse early in my freshman year of college. Prior to that, I was using an older Logitech M310 mouse. However, it started to become unreliable, so I started to search for a replacement. In searching for a mouse, I desired an ergonomic, bluetooth mouse with a horizontal scrollwheel. This happened to be the only option on the market that fit those requirements. I was not disappointed with the purchase.Wheel - The primary wheel has been even more useful than I anticipated. I did not realize how much time I spent scrolling until I started using this mouse. The horizontal wheel has also been a revelation in my computer usage. In using Microsoft OneNote, I can use that wheel in tandem with the regular wheel for 2 axis scrolling. Meanwhile, if I have Spotify or Chrome open, I can use the horizontal wheel to control audio volume. Having this extra utility has been very convenient.Sensor - Additionally, its sensor is fantastic. It is very accurate, and with adjustable DPI settings, can be adjusted to your preferences. I have not used it on glass, but have successfully used it on some surfaces other mice would not track on (such as fabric or carpet).Software - My only complaint is that the software Logitech provides can be occasionally finnicky, althought it is generally reliable. The primary issues occur if you have the mouse on for a long time (say, 8 hours), as it seems to forget the customized actions I have set for certain buttons in certain applications. That said, a simple turning off and back on of the mouse rectifies any issues. I have not tried its multidevice capabilities, so I canot speak to that.Battery - The battery has been wonderful. This is my first rechargeable mouse, and it has proven to be remarkable. I have charged it probably 3 or 4 times total after using it for hours per day for 7 months straight, and has provided me with warnings each time it needed charging.Ergonomics - This mouse's ergonomics are fantastic. Prior to purchasing this, my wrist hurt after using my computer for more than 2or 3 hours. Now, I hae used my laptop for periods of 10 or more hours with no wrist fatigue. Conincidentally, the ergonomics also make the mouse visually unique. I have gotten numerous compliments on this mouse by my peers.Summary - Overall, this mouse is easily one of my favorite pieces of technology. If you are looking for a gaming mouse, you may want to look elsewhere. If you are an engineer using CAD all the time, you may want to look at the 3dConnexion CadMouse. However, if you are looking for a very high quality mouse for general computer work and productivity, this is a fantastic option, if not the best.

I love this mouse. This mouse is a great deal, some mice are more expensive than this and this is a good deal. I wanted to use this with my work laptop only as that's what I needed it for. Ergonomics, amazing. Scroll wheel, best one out there. Click sound took some time to get used to. The issue that I had to return it was that I wasn't able to customize the mouse. My company and many others don't allow you to download personal software onto your work device, so I couldn't use any of the customization with the mouse. If you are allowed to download the software, I'd buy it immediately. It's definitely not a gamer mouse, feel or use. But a ergonomic work mouse, great

This is a fantastic mouse but IMO there are 2 drawbacks that kind of cooncide. First, if anything accidental happens Logitech or Amazon do not cover that in a protection plan and second, there are no spare parts so if it breaks you have to buy a new one and for the cost you would think they could help in some way. I dropped it and thought I broke the scroll wheel so I called a few rapair shops and Logitech. Most repair shops don't work on mice and neither does Logitech. If you find spare parts online they are from random second hand people and may not work so they are sketchy. Luckily after talking on the phone with customer service at Logitech she had me blow air into the wheel and everything worked again, so you can say it's quite durable. Also, there are no scuffs or scratches after dropping it. Would recommend and would absolutely buy again, it's very difficult to go back to a regular mouse now.

Good: Just about everything. The ergonomics are much better than I'd thought at first view. Hand/wrist position is perfect; I'm using a mouse pad with built-in wrist rest but I suspect the latter isn't necessary with this mouse. Tracking is smooth and precise on every surface I've tried it on, including my denim-clad leg. Button action is very light, but your hand position is such that you're unlikely to click accidentally. Selector button on the underside lets you switch between three different receivers, which works well once you figure out how to pair it with a new receiver (see below.) Haven't used it long enough to verify battery life, but four days of intensive use hasn't fazed it. USB-C charging might put some people off but it comes with its own cable, and USB-C enables rapid charging. After four days of several-hours-daily use, I can't think of anything bad to say about this mouse. Except...Bad: I bought this along with Logi's MX Keys keyboard, so I needed to pair both with both receivers. The getting-started sticker on the mouse's underside wasn't quite clear on the pairing process, so I looked it up on Logi's website. No problem: power up the mouse, press the ""connect"" button, plug in the receiver, and done. I flip the mouse over, switch it on, receiver select ""1"" starts flashing as it's supposed to, I press the...wait a minute, there's no ""connect"" button. Online manual clearly shows it between the power switch and the sensor. Nope. So about 20 minutes of research and fumbling later, I discover that it's necessary to download and install 200 meg of Logitech bloatware, click through multiple screens of features of the device I've already paired, and pleas to open an account (nope) and send my every click to Logi for analytics (double nope,) and then figure out how to get to the pairing screen. Once I found that, the pairing was almost effortless. My point, however, is that none of this should have been necessary. It's a MOUSE, people, it should be plug-and-play to at least get it working before considering enhancements. At the very least you shouldn't have to run an online gauntlet to be able to use what is now a fundamental peripheral. Would have sucked if I hadn't had internet access at the time. Also...Ugly: The required pairing software doesn't work on Linux, which means I had to install said bloatware on my work machine and pair up both receivers there. It wasn't a problem, but could easily have become one if the system admins took note.Bottom line: The MX Master 3 lives up to its reputation. This replaced an older Logi mouse, and I don't miss the old one a bit. Five stars, minus one because the apparently deliberate move to force users to install an app just to make the device usable - and a Windows-only app at that - annoyed me just enough to take back that fifth star.

"
It's a really nice mouse, I'd highly recommend it.  My only minor complaint is that I would prefer only a single thumb button for back rather than the forward/back buttons.  I only ever need back and it awkward to move my thumb back to miss the forward button.

This is my second mx mouse. The first i had for about 7 years. I had to replace it as the battery started dying.I use the bluetooth connection instead of the usb dongle provided as the dongle seems to have lag problems and responce issues.Game play is very responsive, using bluetooth.Having the ablility to use this on 3 different computers is a plus as i use it with my laptop when traveling.

Logitech has truly improved their product.My previous MX Master 2S thumb scroll wheel had an annoying bit of ""slack"" before feeling like it was doing anything. Not just response lag, but a physical looseness that would take almost a 1/4 of a stroke to start feeling like there was any resistance in rotating an internal mechanism... very hard to describe, but if you have a 2S, you know the feeling. It was even more sad that the $30 VicTsing Pioneer mouse sold on Amazon had a more direct feeling thumb wheel. Well, Logitechs back on top... This MX3 thumb wheel is AMAZING. A nicely weighted and direct feel. No slack or looseness and just overall feels more robust. It's now a pleasure to use.The overall shape of the 2S was visually more appealing to me, but the MX3 feels ergonomically superior in every way. It has a more aggressive cant to it, feeling more natural in the palm. The size is just barely smaller than the 2S, a welcome change for me as it fits my hand much better where the S2 felt a touch too large.The MX3 palm to thumb rest material is softer. The front/back buttons just above your thumb feel better placed and more usable than the S2 design, where those buttons were cleverly diagonally separated... it was a neat look, but this one is a bit more intuitive to use. A more “second nature” feel.The main scroll wheel feels better too! The new magnetic auto-catch system is a pleasure to experience, more refined than the ""clutch dump"" feeling of the 2S. It has a more muted noise in ratchet mode... but I tend to leave it on speed scroll mode as it feels better suited for my Mac that way. Maybe it's just me, but the on screen scrolling is better matched to what you're doing on the mouse as well.There's a recess in the hard plastic frame below the thumb/gesture button this time... With that relief cut, the press feels easier to accomplish. I felt like I needed to put more effort behind my thumb to get that button pressed on the 2S - though I've oddly read other peoples experience to be the opposite of mine on here... For me, this is a nice update.Overall, this mouse knocks it out of the park. It looks like an ""uglier"" new model, but once it's in your palm, you'll be changing your tune so fast and knocking the 2S for being pretty, but useless in comparison. The MX3 feels like an extension of your body - ESPECIALLY if you felt the 2S was just slightly too big for you.One little annoyance... The mouse isn't compatible with scrolling in my MacOS Calendar... Here's to hoping a software revision will fix that down the line.

It’s big fits very nicely in the palm of my hand. The scroll is amazing you can scrol down to the bottom of the page with one swift movement i would call it endless scroll without having to constantly move your finger a few times. There are buttons to go left to right and right and left buttons to click on top. It has a usb-c charge and you can even use it while it charges. Best feature is that i can use it with three different devices. On the bottom is an on off switch and another button to sync it with 3 devices. An iPad, a computer , or another computer or tablet. Very versatile my wife kept taking it to her home office when i wasn’t home so i bought her one too.

Had to return the first one, which was DOA. After hours with Tech support, I decided to send it back. I decided that this could happen and I used other products and mice from this company and decided to go with a replacement. This one is great! I highly recommend it to the person who likes to do work on the computer or a nerd like myself who does everything from bills to music and whatever on the computer. good fit. Light in weight too. I haven't found a use for the side scroll wheel yet but give me time.

I have tried several specialty ergonomic mice for wrist pain. This is the fourth mouse I have purchased in the last few months trying to find something comfortable. This mouse is the one. Response time is excellent, battery life is excellent, and connection options are excellent. It is built sturdy (a little heavy) and the feel is superb.It is very comfortable and my wrist pain is gone. The price of this mouse is a bit high but worth the investment in my opinion.My only issue is that the Logitech software does not let you change the thumb wheel to allow vertical scrolling. You either have to get key remapping software or change the remapping of the up and down of the wheel to ""up/down arrow"" or page up/down"" in the Logitech software. This makes scrolling awkward because the item has to be clicked into focus before scrolling.  If they add that option, this would be 5 stars.

"
Pros-Much improved ergonomics from the last gen.  Better scrolling experience too. New magnetic scroll wheel ratchet is a big improvement. Good connectivity with the dongle no noticeable latency. Haven’t tried the Bluetooth extensively with this mouse. Previous versions had a slight latency over Bluetooth.Nit picking-Optical sensor location is a bit too low for my liking. I would prefer the optical sensor to be essentially directly beneath, or in front of the scroll wheel for most precise curser tracking and control.The mouse still preforms does well with the current design but could be improved.The mouse left and right clicks are relatively  quiet, no complaints, though the tactility could be more crisp.Overall great mouse use it for 8+ hrs a day. Can potentially make your wrist sore where it contacts the table. A wrist rest or slidy wrist support is recommended for prolonged use.

I'm a big fan of Logitech's MX line because it's all the peripheral with none of the gaming attitude sprinkled on (RGB lighting, weird shapes/colors, etc.) The MX Master 3S seemed like the perfect companion to my new MX Mechanical Mini keyboard (which I really like). I like that they use Bolt (faster and more secure) and wanted to get rid of my MX 3's unifying receiver. I also like seeing the battery percentage in Logi Options+ which is unique to this latest generation of products.Before I even got it, there was one thing that I held against the new mouse: It thought I was going to hate the new ""quiet"" clicking sound of the Master 3S. I thought that it would interfere with the tactile feel of using it and make things boring. I was wrong.Once you have to pull an all nighter because some release/project/deadline is approaching and you have to make sure everything gets submitted/processed/merged, you will appreciate that you will not have to endure the menacing high-pitched clicking of your mouse as you move about your computer's GUI at 3:30AM.The very satisfying ""thock""s you get from the mechanical keyboard combined with the quiet yet satisfying clicking of the new mouse, and you get a setup that is not offensive in any environment; from the home office all nighter to the day-to-day office use, the latest gen Logi MX line is all focused on zen and getting you into the proper ""work"" headspace.

First off, this mouse is amazing.  Having a side-scrolling wheel is great for large excel documents, or for a programmer, when that code starts drifting off the page a bit.Additionally, I didn't realize this mouse had a ratchet AND free-spinning scroll wheel for the main up/down scroller.  This is honestly the most amazing feature ever, the mouse scrolls with a detente just like any regular mouse, but if you have a large document you can flick it with some force and it will just spin for 10-15 seconds, and the spin is amazing.  Nice and silent.  The wheel has some weight to it which gives it some inertia.  I had fun spinning the wheel, then clicking into a window and automatically seeing the document start shooting down.  So fun!Now to the BAD!!!1) There is no slot for the RF dongle.  I use Bluetooth on my main computer, but I could still want to connect to a foreign computer when I'm in the field, and if there's no holder for that on the mouse itself, there's no way I can figure out some way to always have it on me.2) The side-scroll is a LITTLE forward for my hand, I would have liked if it was a little farther back.  I find myself having to re-position my hand and reach for it when I need to use it.3) My third finger (ring finger?) rests just to the right of the right clicker... and although the placement feels perfect and I can get ""underneath"" the mouse for easy re-positioning, I find that my finger lands on a sharp edge which makes my finger sore.4) The main scroller just broke an hour ago, I've been hoping that it will re-fix itself, but currently it will only free-spin and not ratchet.  That means that I'm constantly bumping it and making my window jump.****EDIT****My last point (reason #4) for giving this a 4-star review was because I thought my ratchet-scroll had broken and got jammed into freespin-only.  Turns out that the button on the mouse next to the scroll-wheel (which is usually used to change DPI) is actually an ON/OFF enable for the rachet/freespin mode.  I don't know why you would want to turn off such a nice feature ever... and really I think it's silly to have a button which toggles OFF such a great instrument, but for whatever reason, I missed the instructions which detailed this functionality and I must have hit the button by accident without realizing it.  Review changed back to 5-star but again, this mouses still isn't perfect (9 out of 10, or 4.5 star).For ERGONOMICS it gets a 3/5 because of the sharp ""edge"" that your third finger rests on.  Two weeks later, it is still making my ring finger sore where my finger meets the edge.  That is poor design if you ask me, all it takes is one day of testing to discover that it's uncomfortable.  Fix this and it's a 5/5.

This is an amazing mouse.Stealth clicking and infinite scroll are world changing, and the new software features are really amazing.only complaint if the lack of easy on-the-fly DPI adjustment with hard ware buttons

I have a large hand and to get the maximum effect front the ergonomics of the mouse, it was uncomfortable for me to place the mouse in the palm of my hand. Additionally, my pinkie finger was left dragging all over the desk. Otherwise, with time I’m sure the mouse would’ve been great.

Iended up buying two of thee, white for my wife and black for me. Her's is already showing dark smudges...The gestures don't feel natural yet, even after a month, but they work most of the time without having to attempt it twice. Iwas using a wired macro (12 side buttons) before this and was worried Iwould lose some quick actions. I was able to customize across various apps through the Logi+ software to keep all the actions I needed but if you can't download the software to the machine you want to use this on, then I would not choose this mouse.My wife has yet to discover and use the gestures but she is not much of a productivity focused person working mostly from her phone doing sales. Iam a product manager though and don't spend much time working on anything other than my computer.

***Update***It's been a few months now and I've taken my MX Master 3 back out of the drawer.I've been using it exclusively now, and don't remember the last time I wanted to switch back to the Performance MX.In short, it's grown on me. Here's why:• Very lightweight• I'm now apparently hooked on having a horizontal scroll wheel• OUTSTANDING battery life. I've only charged this because I get nervous about how eerily long it's been since the previous charge. I've easily gone over two months of daily usage without any charging.• Bluetooth connectivity. That basically upgrades my laptop by one USB port. That's huge.• I have a dual boot OS. This makes the device-pairing button very handy.***Update End; Original review follows***This is objectively a very good mouse.However I am honestly disappointed with my MX Master 3.The problem is that I owned a Logitech MX Revolution & currently own multiple Performance MX mice.I absolutely love them, but they're are getting old and worn. So I decided to see what Logitech had to offer in their new models.I tried to like it, but after a week of exclusive use, I put it in a drawer and have gone back to my Performance MX.Pros:-Bluetooth connection capability is great. Freeing up a USB port by not requiring a receiver is a big plus.  Both the wireless receiver & bluetooth connectivity has been responsive and solid in my experience.-The MX Master 3 is lighter than the Performance MX.-The ridged texture on the thumb rest/button is an improvement. You feel like you have more control with this enhancement.Cons:-The MX Master 3 is shorter lengthwise compared to the Performance MX. The shorter length doesn't support the bottom of my palm very well, causing my wrist to droop. This is also made worse by the taller height of the MX Master 3.-I had issues with the behavior of the scroll wheel on webpages. The free-spin worked fine, but the incremental setting seems coarse and abrupt compared to the Performance MX. The moment that I stopped using my MX Master 3 was when I got frustrated with the scrolling action while browsing the web.I had to keep switching to free-spin to get back to parts of the webpage that the incremental scroll wouldn't stop on.*****(This turned out to be a software issue, not the mouse. See update at bottom for)Overall, it really is a nice mouse, but apparently I've been spoiled.Maybe Logitech should consider creating a model that uses the superior form of the Performane MX and add some of more beneficial modern tech (e.g. Bluetooth, lighter & longer-lasting battery)Until then, I will stick with the Performance MX as long as I can.

As I was looking for a new mouse to replace my M720 Triathlon (still an excellent mouse) I kept hearing about the MX Master. Truth be told, I’ve been hearing about it in different circles for years. I finally took the plunge and couldn’t be happier. It’s been flawless. I have zero lag. And that’s with using it between 2 PCs, via Multiplicity. The dedicated side scroll wheel is a very welcome addition for me, as I practically live in Excel. Profile switching is easy enough if I need it (I usually don’t, as I use my old M 720 as a travel mouse). The quiet buttons are also very pleasant and I don’t miss loud mouse clicks (although I like the sound of my mechanical keyboard so you’ll have to figure that one out…). Overall, this mouse is superb and worth the higher price tag.

I love this mouse!The clicks are dead silent and feel good (in my opinion)The software is impressive.My only issues with it are: - The scroll wheel is a bit heavy in ratchet mode, and the free-scroll is a bit too much. I like the Logitech Lift scroll wheel much more- The horizontal scroll wheel is a little awkward to use and I have accidentally triggered it a couple times (but maybe these issues will go away with extended use).I haven't used any other Logitech MX mice, but I have used plenty of Razer mice and Anker's vertical mice.I love the shape and feel of this mouse, but for my use case, I will likely stick with the Logitech Lift.The Lift isn't as feature rich, but for a mouse, I don't need the horizontal scroll wheel or the extra button on the base.Very impressive mouse and I would recommend it to anyone who wants something more ergonomic but doesn't want to go full vertical!

My wrist hurts less using this mouse, compared to using the Anywhere mouse.  It has a slight tilt for right handed people, and you can rest your hand on it.  A bit more tilt, making this a vertical mouse, would be a nice improvement.I have medium sized hands (medium sized gloves are a perfect fit), and this mouse is a bit too large for my hand.  I hold the mouse at a bit of an angle, so I can ""choke up"" on it to reach the clickers.  This mouse would be a bad fit for people with small hands (most women).  Obviously, this mouse was designed by men, for men with larger hands.Cat hair finds its way into the opening for the optical sensor causing poor mouse control until the hair is removed.  There are thin unsealed cracks between the parts surrounding this opening, and they provide ample opportunity for cat hair to lodge in it.  Unlike the Anywhere mouse, this mouse doesn't have a cover that easily comes off for when you need to remove the cat hair.My main complaint with this mouse is how easy cats are able to left and right click the mouse while you are using it.  The Anywhere mouse has a lip around the outer perimeter of the mouse keys, preventing this.  With the MX mouse if you slide the top into something (like your drink, or snacks) it will left click.  So when you move the mouse to keep the cat from clicking it you pull your hand away, the mouse hits something on your desk and it left clicks.  Of course, the pointer has moved above the X in the top right hand corner, and you have closed the program you were using.  If you don't pull the mouse away, the cat will bump it, causing a click, and we all know, cats know all the keyboard shortcuts and the worst places to click, so this is equally disastrous.

Thumb buttons make it easy to navigate folders. Side scrolling wheel is excellent for excel sheets. Silent clicks are perfect for in person meetings.

I love the ergonomics of this mouse.  I love the battery life.  I love the weight.  I love that I can have two different mice on the same dongle, and have three different devices per mouse.  I bought this one after also using their MX vertical mouse and finding that it seemed to work better over my finicky PCoIP work from home system than other wireless mice did.  Smoother, with fewer incidents of stuttering.I switch back and forth between this and the vertical mouse to keep my arm from getting sore throughout the day, which is why I like that they both can work with the same dongle.  I just grab the one I want and turn it on.  Or, if I want to use one with my laptop I just push the button on the bottom of either mouse to toggle it to a different device.The thing I don't like is the weird scroll wheel.  If you scroll it too quickly, it goes into some kind of hyper scroll mode.  The tactile feedback of the scroll wheel goes away and the wheel spins more freely.  I have never found it terribly useful, and more often than not it happens too late or at a weird time when I'm changing programs and something I don't want to be zooming or scrolling does just that- like a web page suddenly zooming out until I can't read anything or thumbnails shrinking away to nothing.  On my own computer I can turn that off using the Logitech drivers, which is cool, but on my company-managed linux box I'm stuck with default drivers, so the mouse does what it will.  I work around it, and it's obviously not too much of an issue, because I'm giving it four stars.  But I wish I could disable it permanently.As to the battery life- I don't think I have ever actually run the batteries down on either of my Logitech MX mice. I usually just think, ""man, have I charged my mouse at all in the last couple of months?"" and throw it on the charger before they ever run out. But maybe that's because I turn them off when I'm not using them.

I absolutely love the ergonomics of this mouse, and the magnetic scroll wheel is a game charger. I can't get used to normal scroll wheels any more, they feel archaic. My only gripe is with the rubbery texture, it feels great but isn't as durable as I would have liked it to be.

It's a great mouse! It also works on a high gloss white table or glass surface. I'm suprised!The mouse itself feels really good. I like the silent clicks and configuration options.CONSthe pricethe scrolling is sometimes lagging. Not on the wheel itself (nothing mechanical) but on pages or pdfs.

I’m a normal person that doesn’t do crazy stuff with computers. My job requires a ton of excel spreadsheets and various other things.  My old mouse had a delay and didn’t go sideways.  I have the M1 MacBook Air.  I bought an adapter to plug it straight into my computer, when I’m working from the coffee shop or when I’m home I use a hyperdrive 4k 10 in 1 to run another screen and plug in all the extras.  This mouse has quick reactions time and makes working from home a little easier.  I know some might call it over kill, but I love how comfortable the mouse is, how it goes from side to side and up and down flawlessly.  I highly suggest this for anyone that wants a mouse that makes life a bit easier!

The mouse is brilliant at tracking, easy to connect, and extremely soft to the touch. Buttons are quiet and overall I am quite satisfied.However, with the ""Pale Grey"" mouse, the paint used to turn it white does not stay on.  If you see the photography, it appears dirty, but that is not dirt. The white outer layer is wearing away and the black plastic from underneath is showing through.  I have used this mouse less than 1 week and this is the condition it is in.  I expected a white mouse would require more routine cleaning, but I have not touched the mouse with any cleaning product at this point.  The wear is from my clean hands using the mouse, period.  Disappointing to say the least.

This mouse replaced a MS Sculpt Ergonomic mouse. While the Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard fits / works extremely well for me, the mouse goes from ergonomic and accurate to glichy and erratic. The worst is trying to file away emails, only to have a message drop into the wrong folder plus having a folder drop into another, requiring a bit of a search to find out where things went.The Logitech MX Master 3 has been in use for over a month now, and it is accurate and smooth. The fit is nice in my hands. The dongle is the third (others the keyboard and my headset) but it seems to ""play well"" with the others. Having multiple buttons and dials is overkill for me, but they can be easily customized to sit quiet.Overall, I would recommend this mouse for anyone needing a reliable, ergonomic, wireless mouse.

I'm very happy with this mouse for my home office.  The ""silent"" button clicks, the smooth scroll wheel, the great-feeling side-scroll wheel, and easy connectivity all make this a slam-dunk for anybody looking for an appropriate mouse to work all week with.It connected to my laptop directly (no need for the included USB dongle), the auto-installed software isn't intrusive and didn't set off any alarms on my corporate laptop.It has an overall great feel, with a weighty body, well-thought-out profile for your hand, and premium-feeling buttons.  I wish that I'd bought a nice mouse years ago!

Excellent wireless mouse for work. Ergonomically, feels really good in hand, and I love the possibility to swipe left and right to change from one virtual desktop to another. For gaming like First Person Shooters, it somehow feels less responsive than a dedicated gaming mouse (set at the same DPI), but nothing unplayable.The battery life is great. After one month of usage without charging, the battery is half depleted, so this mouse can last 2 months on a single charge, which is impressive compared to gaming wireless mouses (the lack of RGB is likely helping in that regard).

I’ve been searching for an awesome mouse that is also quiet as I work from home on the computer and often do zoom meeetings. I wanted the most comfortable mouse and most responsive on different surfaces as I usually go from room to room (or the bed or couch) with my laptop. Previous gen was glitching on different materials and the connection with the receiver didn’t often work. Also a priority was a quiet mouse (and I’m hoping for the worlds quietest keyboard to match one day) as the typing and clicking sounds get picked up in meetings. Doing telehealth I am frequently typing and clicking while talking to document and the quiet feature and responsiveness were the selling point. Please make a keyboard that is inaudible as well so my clients can have some peace and quiet

The best mouse in the world

I had the MX Master 3 prior to owning this model and became a fan instantly.  When my computer bag was stolen and my MX Master 3 went with it, this was the first thing that I had to replace.  I went two days using a traditional mouse and I hated every second.  I replaced the MX Master 3 with the 3S and while there are some very technical differences both mouses ultimately function the same.  The one difference that I can really tell is how much quieter the MX Master 3S is compared to the MX Master 3, I have had colleagues even comment on this feature.  If you work in excel the functionality of the mouse is phenomenal and a must in my opinion.  Logitec has done a fantastic job with the design and functionality and they have a fan for life.

I bought the MX Master 3S because everyone and their brother heard my MX Master 3 for Mac make those annoying ""click"" sounds during Zoom calls. They weren't supposed to know I wasn't paying attention to them drone on. I had to take action. The mouse was killing my ability to surf the web/ do work/ play games, so I decided to spring for the MX Master 3s. The reviews online said, not worth the upgrade. Listen to me, if you are concerned about annoying ""click"" and it is a definite ""click,"" then buy this immediately. It's super quiet. The action is super nice, and all your friends will be amazed at your newfound ability to focus.  But you and I will know better, now won't we?

I couldn't wait to get my hands on the mouse, as it has been hailed by many reviewers as the best productivity mouse out there.PROS• The build quality is top-notch. The material used feels grippy which prevents slipping• The buttons are tactile and solid. Horizontal scroll wheel is a great addition• Logi Option+ app adds even more customisation and shortcuts to enhance productivity per appCONS• I cannot believe how laggy the pointer is on MacOS. I've tried tweaking pointer speed and DPI but nothing seems to work• I am also unable to update the firmware, which is weird for a recently released product. Same applies to the MX Keys Mini keyboard• USB A receiver doesn't make any sense, when this was built with Mac in mind. My MacBook Pro 14"" has x3 USB C ports, which means I have to use an adapter. Same goes for charging.Overall, I'm slightly disappointed with this mouse. For a $100 mouse, it shouldn't be as laggy as a $20 mouse. I'm seriously considering returning this mouse, and getting something else as the choppy pointer impedes my productivity.All this is after a full day of use across Windows and MacOS over bluetooth and USB receiver. I feel like the cons outweighs the pros.

I've sat in front a computer in my career for more than 25 years and this is the best mouse I've ever used. It's comfortable and ergonomic, so my hand isn't sore or tired at the end of the day. The buttons click quietly, but in a satisfying way. It lasts for weeks between charging, and the charge port is such that I can use it while it's charging.The best part, by far? The scroll wheel. It has the usual Logitech feature of a small button to unlock the wheel to free-spin, but even better - if you spin the wheel hard, it auto-unlocks and spins quickly and then re-locks when you stop it. I can fly to the bottom of a scrollbar so easily I don't know how I lived without this feature.I'm not a serious gamer so I can't speak to that, but I've played a couple of old FPS games and it seemed to work great.I'm using this on a M1 Mac Mini via bluetooth and the performance is excellent. I've heard that you can also setup the dongle to possibly get better performance, but in my testing it was no better.

I love this mouse. My only complaint is the placement of the ""forward"" and ""back"" buttons as they are to close together and placed to far back. I had to program them both as ""back"" buttons to avoid accidentally clicking the forward button. Other than that, love it!

The angle took a little bit to get used to but it's so much better than any mouse I have ever used. I have tendonitis in my thumb from office work/typing for years.The scroll goes VERY fast but not right away, I work on websites so it's nice if you have to scroll that after a while it will auto/fast scroll and it's really nice. The mouse of so ergonomic. SO glad I got this and would recommend it to anyone that doesn't want a small/flat mouse.

Maybe I’m it picking but I bought v1 10 years ago and continued to buy replacements. I’ve been using this for a few years now and while it has the same shape and features as v1 it feels like the quality of materials has slipped.With v3 the mouse clicks feel a little squishier and have a higher tiny sounding click to them. The rubber where the thumb rests picks up and retains oils from skin more. The vertical scroll wheel clicks louder and feels cheaper. The slide pads on the bottom show wear a lot sooner than v1 too. It still works great. It just feels like the same product that has had cost cutting measures applied to it.The horizontal scroll wheel is the major benefit here if you do any design or coding work. I’d rather pay more to get the lux feel of v1 back though.

Great mouse. Form, fit, finish, usability all top notch. My one complaint is the setting will not transfer between computers with out the use of its app. This is a problem because my work computer cannot install the app making all the good functions worthless.This is not the case with the original MX master.

This mouse is simply amazing.. For anyone who multi tasks I don't think there is a more customizable mouse on the market.  When you download the software you can customize everything button, rollers and the software interface is easy to program and esthetically pleasing.  There's literally hundreds of ways to customize all the functions fir any type of user.I'm not a gamer but I presume this has to be one of if not the most customizable pieces of hardware on the market with the exception of a joy stick.  For an office user who uses multiple spread sheets, word documents and publishing software and needs to multi task between all of your work this mouse will do everything you could possibly need and more.As for me, I don't use very much of this mouses potential at all. The reason I purchased it was because it looked really cool and seemed to be well built so coming from a consumer who doesn't mind spending a little more and making a big splash, I am extremely impressed.  It is extremely well built and feels very solid when in use. It's ergonomically perfect and extremely comfortable to continuous hourly use. It can be used with the USB dongle or with blue tooth if you need to free up a USB port. The battery life seems to last forever. I've been using it for over a month and I'm at 99% of battery life.  In the unlikely event your battery goes dead you can plug the charge cord into a USB port. Bottom line, if you don't mind spending a little more on of the most programmable mouse on the market weather you're a full out gamer, a 10K office working or code writer or just someone who wants a totally cool, bullet proof, comfortable cool looking mouse, this is for you.  If it fits any of these parameters you can't go wrong.

My complains is that could be a bit smaller, a little too tall for my medium hand. And this is a big one this is why I take 2 stars. No internal memory? How come in a mouse at this price range...

Coming from a Logitech G9X (a weighted gaming mouse), the lightness of the mouse and tallness of the hand positioning took about a month to fully get used to. Now that I'm used to these things, the mouse is very comfortable for daily use but you definitely want to have a separate mouse for gaming. The clicks are definitely stiffer than the G9X (also another reason to keep a different mouse for gaming) but I don't notice it anymore.I almost bought the MX Master 3 Anywhere mouse instead because its smaller in the palm but now that I've given this a proper chance I'm used to it and love it.LOVE the 3 device switching ability. I have a Macbook Pro (using bluetooth), my PC (using the included logitech dongle) and my TV (bluetooth) mapped. The switching ability on the MX Master 3 and MX Keys is super smooth and convenient. Wish the button wasn't on the underside of the mouse though, I switch a lot and need to pick up the mouse every time, so that is an opportunity Logitech has for the MX Master 4.I don't like the side scrolling wheel position as it's awkwardly positioned for my thumb. There is also a slight lag to side scrolling initially. i'd prefer they kept that feature on the main wheel, that was great for me.The textured rubberized coating on where your thumb rests feels nice but is suspect, I've seen some users report it disintegrating and turning to a sticky mush over time, not sure if that is a rare defect or due to people cleaning their mouse with rubbing alcohol or something that hurts the finish. Hoping mine doesn't have that flaw with time, being careful not to get it dirty.Love the charging and battery life. I've owned it forover a month and use it everyday all day and haven't needed to charge it yet.I'd recommend it if you work from home or aren't gaming. Very solid if you give it a chance.

I work as a programmer and I love how ergonomic this mouse is. I can use it for ~8 hours a day and feel little fatigue. The battery life is also great.I also like to play games and I prefer to switch to a different mouse for gaming. This mouse feels a little heavy and clunky for the games I'm playing but it would be fine for a casual gamer.The clicks are soft but satisfying.The bottom button is a little hard to hit for smaller hands like mine but it's doable.Overall I like using this as a daily driver but I switch to a more gaming styled mouse when gaming at night.

The mouse and keyboard are the tools of my trade (plus my brain). I'm 55 years old, and finally, finally, I invested in this relatively expensive mouse. And it was worth it. Should have done this decades ago. This. Is. Nice. It has some heft; it wakes up immediately (assuming you tell Windows NOT to let Bluetooth go to sleep mode), and it looks and feels very premium. And it works. That's a plus, too.

Pros:- Ergonomic fit for the average hand, unlike low-profile mouses that are tiring to use after some time- Logitech app connection to customize scroll and cursor speed- Ratchet or smooth scroll mode available- That near-silent clickCons:- Slightly heavier than the average mouse, but it feels durable- No battery level indicator on the mouse itselfMy upgrade from the Mx Master 3 to the 3S is worth every penny. The 3's loud click bothered me so much, so please do yourself and everyone else a favor by purchasing the 3S.

I’ve owned a lot of different mouse over the years and NONE have compared to this one!

With the robust customization and features you can do with this mouse it makes everything more efficient when doing work, gaming, or just browsing the web.

I bought the MX Master 3 in November 2021.  It went out - wouldn't take a charge or connect - 13 months later.  When the Mouse is working it performs beautifully.  Its smooth, the side to side scrolling is very nice and provides simultaneous response and accuracy across multiple screens or just on my MacBook.The sad truth is that Logitech isn't just making the mice like they used to...  however, I love the ergonomic form and glide (when it works) so I bought the 2nd Generation (Master 3S) but this time I paid for the insurance, so that I can get a new one when it breaks for a 1/3 of the cost.

I originally bought the S2 for work and loved it so much that i wanted to buy another for my Home computer.  I saw that they had a newer ver.3 out so i Bought this one for home.  I use it ALL the time.  Bought back in January and i run it for 10+ hours a day and turn it off when my day is done.  Only needed to charge it 3 times in 8 months.  I have large hands so the Ergonomics are Fantastic and fit me like a glove but i can see how people with small hands would find this uncomfortable.  The customization of the side scroll wheel is great and the tactile feel of the scroll wheel makes me feel in control.There is only one thing I see wrong with this mouse which is what prompted me to write this Review.  For the past 3 days (the month of August 2020) I've noticed that every so often my mouse Stutters.  Sometimes while gaming the mouse is Smooth as melted butter, and sometimes when working in a Chrome browser it stops responding for half a second and I end up miss clicking because of it.  I'm not sure if the receiver dongle is dying or the mouse itself is dying, could be environmental (Maybe my mouse pad is dirty)  but it only seems to do it while NOT gaming.It never occurred to me this happened with my S2 at work until it started happening with my Home mouse since before i bought this one I ordered a new Logi Dongle for my work mouse.  I thought putting my laptop in my bag every day for work might have damaged the dongle  on the S2.  Now that its happening with my Home mouse in a desktop that doesn't move I'm beginning to think the Dongles have a limited life?  Not sure.I'm still giving this 5/5 stars despite the dongle problem since that could be remedied by buying a 13$ replacement dongle.

Bought this for the bluetooth connection to my work MacBook.  Yes - it will pair with the work machine, but I am unable to configure it due to our work firewall restrictions. Even so, it does the mouse basics - clicks, scrolls, etc. The thumb horizontal scrolls do not pair with the MacBook, but If I decide to use this on my home PC then it will come in handy.I was having issues with my thumb tendon getting sore after a full work day of using a $15 logitech mouse. The new mouse - because it is more of a palm mouse with the extra thumb support seems to have reduced the issue (less thumb pain).I took off one star because the ""fly wheel"" feature on the mouse only seems to work on some of the pages I work on. And even then it doesn't spin forever like some of the videos proclaim.All in all - this is a good ergonomic mouse for doing home office work. For gaming, I'd recommend going with a mouse specifically made for that.  For office tools and light design work, this seems to be more than enough of a match.

I have used the previous model for > 1 year (only purchased this model as I was taking the old one to work, ditching the wired non-ergo mouse there). I was expecting essentially the same mouse, but this is a significant upgrade - even MORE ergonomic and comfortable - and oddly more responsive and accurate if that helps for gamers. As someone who works long hours and long ago lost time for any joy, I cannot say how it does with games. BUT, for office (or home office) workers: if a cloud could be a mouse, this is it.  Putting in gulag hours and don’t want your wrist falling off? Look no further!

The device is extremely easy to setup and use. The clicks are very quiet, smooth, and enjoyable to use. The scroll wheel is precise, fast, and works with ease. The device has the best fit and feel of any mouse that is out there as it feels like it was personally molded to fit your hand.

The scroll wheel is very annoying to use.  It took me under 2 minutes to determine this was going to be returned.  Logitech got cute with the magnetic wheel which when scrolled quickly activates a magnet to continue fast scrolling.  It is a novelty and nothing more, fixing a problem that didn't exist and in the process introducing a much bigger problem: the in between fast and slow scroll.If you scroll slowly, it is precise but barely moves the page at all.  If you scroll quickly, it's a crap-shoot whether the ""fast scroll"" engages.  Part of this is having to un-learn the way you use a traditional scroll wheel, which I would argue is a dumb value proposition to begin with.  The proper way to use the fast-scroll is not to scroll quickly, but to ""flick"" the wheel up/down (similar to how you would flick a touchpad), and then very quickly ""stop"" the wheel with your finger when it's at the point you desire (good luck with that).In between the extremely slow and absurdly fast scroll is where 90% of us spend our day, and this mouse is absolute garbage for that purpose.  It's difficult to describe without having used it, but let's just say it's probably not what you're used to (and inconsistent).2 stars because I like the other features and the ergonomics are decent, but a wheel is the centerpiece of a mouse and this is just a failure on Logitech's part.  They should abandon this cutesy magnetic thing and go back to what worked.  Novelty for the sake of novelty is not a good idea.

I never thought I would rave about a mouse and always thought that traditional mouse’s we’re practical. However this mouse changed my opinion and I can never go back to a regular mouse again. I didn’t know the pain in my hand was related to the mouse I was using and the doctor suggested I switch to a more ergonomical mouse, and so I did. This mouse is great and it comes with many great features I didn’t know I needed. Great job Logitech.

BEAUTIFUL mouse; Even though it is a little heavier than I usually like, it's probably the most comfortable handfeel I've had from any mouse I've owned and can use it comfortably for long periods of time. Wrist hurts a lot less following long gaming sessions now too. I love all the extra buttons and functionalities available to be customized at my fingertips. The click wheel/smooth scroll for the scroll wheel is buttery smooth and satisfying a.f. to use. My wife loves it so much she wants me to get her one too even though she has a Razer gaming mouse already. Def worth the price tag.

Logitech makes some great peripherals. This mouse is for you if you have large hands like me. It fits very comfortably and the button/scrolling positioning on it is set perfectly where it doesn't get in the way of movement.  Battery life is great on it and I am overall very happy with it along with their wireless ergonomic keyboard.My only complaint is their bluetooth connectivity. Sometimes it would take awhile to connect back on or I would have to turn off the mouse and turn it back on after waking my computer from sleep mode. I know there is a usb  dongle connector for it, but I don't like to use up my ports when I don't have to. If they can get that issue resolved this product would be perfect.

I'm not a gamer, so I'll leave in-depth commentary on latency, programability, etc to those folks.But for something comfortable, with a long battery life and easy, well-placed programable buttons - there is nothing close (and I've gone through about 20 different models in the last few years).Other reviews go into depth - so I'll just say the two things that are absolute game-changers for my work are: - Speed scrolling - seriously, ever have scroll through documents/web pages that are about 2,000 lines long? That's routine for me. The ability to spin that wheel and watch the text literally fly by has been a huge time saver for me. - The top button just behind the scroll wheel. This is defaulted to 'free' the wheel to allow that speed scrolling. Click it and the wheel spins free. But if you spin it quickly, it switches from 'indents' that help control line-by-line scrolling to free-wheel anyway. So I programmed it to bring up the screen snipping tool in Windows 10. I have to document a LOT of screen shots in my work, so being able to quickly scroll to what I need, click this and draw a rectangle to copy to clipboard is phenomenal for my workflow.The USC-C plug for recharging is convenient and battery life, as stated, is excellent. About once a week I plug it in during lunch and have never even had a low battery warning pop up.

My husband had a previous generation of the MX Master and literally wore through the casing from use over the years. He's been wanting this one to replace it for a while, and I gave it to him as a gift. He absolutely loves it and has zero complaints! It looks sleek, is ergonomic, and has great features.

This mouse fits my (larger) hand well. The shape means it is for righties only but that is fine by me. The precision is the best I've used on a mouse to date and while it is a bit pricey it would be worth the price if the multi-device capabilities were more complete. This device pairs with the MX Keys keyboard and they both have the ability to toggle from computer to computer so you can use one mouse & keyboard to control up to three devices. There is some additional driver software you can load on your Windows or Mac (or both) PC's that let you use mouse movements to toggle between computers. When you do this with the mouse both the keyboard and the mouse switch from device A to device B and back again. It works pretty slick. The keyboard has some extra keys that also let you toggle between devices and the mouse has a button underneath. A major flaw, in my view, is that when you use the keys or buttons to switch from computer to computer, the keyboard and mouse do not both switch at once. The mouse software has an option that lets you control whether you want this when you use mouse movement to switch devices but there is no options when using the keys/buttons. If you want to switch computers you have to press the button on the keyboard (very handy) and then pick up the mouse, turn it over, and press another button one or two times, depending on what device you want to switch to. It works but it isn't very user friendly. Ideally, I could press the key on the keyboard to choose the computer and when the keyboard changes over the mouse would too.

I use this mouse for my home business and for general computing. It’s extremely comfortable to use. The shape is truly ergonomic, and it works perfectly on my glass top computer desk without a mouse pad. I am still learning how to program it to optimize it for different applications, but it works perfectly right out of the box. I really like that it has Bluetooth. It saves me a USB port when I use it for my laptop, which only has a few ports! I have a PC and a Mac and it works perfectly on either. The price is high but it's a worthwhile investment in my opinion. I highly recommend it.

So far, I really like this mouse.  It replaced my M720 Triathlon that started having button issues.  It's my first rechargeable mouse, which makes me nervous, and I do wish the device button wasn't on the bottom side, like the Triathlon had on the side, which made it easier to switch between computers, but I do really like the mouse.  Unfortunately, one of the computers is a work computer, and I'm unable to install Flow on it.  I love the feel of it, and the automatic hyperscroll wheel is pretty awesome!  It's also my first mouse with a thumb wheel, which I also and finding extremely useful!

I use this mouse between 3 computers daily. The new silent click is amazing and very helpful when on video meetings!I use it between a windows machine (using the included USB adapter) and use it with 2 macs via bluetooth. The transitions are seamless and I have loved using it. The battery life seems to be very good as I have not yet had to charge it after several weeks of use.

i might just have weird size hands, but this mouse is NOT comfortable at all. the scroll wheel, while a nice gimic, isn't very useful when you're actually trying to scroll fast but controlled. it, if you scroll too fast, the magnet turns off or whatever and then it just goes to the end of the webpage but if you want to stop halfway though it basically wont let you.the other downfall is that the multidevice switch is on the bottom of the mouse. as someone who switches between 2 computers over 30x a day, this is very annoying. whats worse is that you cant remap it to one of the other 3 COMPLETELY useless buttons for me. there's a mode switch on the top which is very convenient but it only switches back and forth the scroll wheel magnet things or just a handful of other functions that I don't need. i NEED it to switch my devices but I have to pick the mouse up and click the button with my other hand. my older mouse had the switching button on the top which allowed me to switch without using both hands. the ergo on my other mouse isn't very good and that's why I bought this in the first place.

I didn't realize how much of a difference a better mouse can make one my work flow. I'm not even a heavy creator but the smoothness and balance really does reduce those little steps. Those micro-steps don't take as long and those milliseconds seem to add up. The infinite scroll feature really does save time working with large Word documents. Especially when highlighting.

Coming from the Magic Mouse, and being very used to swiping gestures, I thought it'd take me a while to get used to it but not at all.Only minor gripes: I wish the device switching weren't under the mouse but closer to the thumb (same with current dev indicator) and i wish the thumb buttons were a little softer… sure at first you might trigger these involuntarily, but I think people would get used to it quickly…Good stuff.

The MX Master 3 mouse has a few issues. Firstly ergonomics.  It may be fine for a someone that uses a claw hand hold with their mouse but if you do a full palm hold you'll find yourself gliding off the back and continously having to readjust. There's also a gesture button that's in a position difficult to activate while attempting the ridiculous gesture.Then there is software.  Logitech Options is for people that don't ever exit microsoft apps or web browsers. If you do any form of software development then skip this. While options allows you to assign keystrokes it does not allow multiple keystrokes. So emacs and visual studio code folk can forget it. And while you normally stay on the keyboard for those apps there are plenty of reasons or places where you would want the programmable mouse buttons to be flexible enough to send multiple key presses. If this mouse could make use of ghub those short comings would be addressed but you'll still have a problem if you like to rest your palm on the mouse. I used to have the G602 for productivity and it was heaven. But it suffered from the double click and eventually no clicks issue. They sell a G502 now but the reviews are horrible so I may switch to a Razer Naga.Update: purchased the g604 and its everything you need. Comfortable, plenty of programable button features, high dpi, onbosrd memory... the only downside is it's scroll wheel.  It's about as good as the g602 but the MX Master 3 scroll wheel is far better. A minor thing. GHub software is a hot mess but it's workable. I'll review separately.

I have been using an MX Revolution for over a decade now.  It recently started acting up so it was a no brainer to look at another mouse from the MX series.  All the reviews were stellar for the Master 3 so it was a no brainer.  I had hoped it would be my mouse for the next decade, but I ended up returning it.The pros.-Well packaged.-Quality looks amazing-The hyper-scroll is AMAZING, even better than the scroll wheel on my OG MX revolution I love.-Good battery life.-Fast wireless connection, I did not try it with bluetoothNow for the Cons-The software is limited when it comes to button mapping.-The gesture button is basically not usable for me its hard to press.-The shape of the mouse would cause me to click when moving it around sometimes-Even though the description says its USB-C its not.  Just the physical connection to the mouse for charging is C.  The dongle that ships with it is normal USB A not C.  If you have a laptop with only Type C you will need an adapter or will have to use bluetooth.-My arm HURT just after the first hour using it.  I used it for a couple weeks and it did get better but not entirely.  My hand and forearm were sore from using this ERGONOMIC mouse, this is the main reason I returned it.The side scroll was basically useless as well.  Hard to use.  It needs some kind of ratcheting system or something.  I am sure there is some function it can be mapped to that would be amazing but it was too sensitive for me.-No Left/Right tilt buttons on scroll wheel.  I never realized how much I used them until I used this mouse without them.  It did have a single middle click but not the left/right tilt.When I initially googled product reviews on the Master 3s, all I got was stellar reviews.  After using it I googled more precisely and found many people that had very similar issues with the mouse when it comes to how uncomfortable it is to use.  for me I think it came down to the shape.  It forces your hand to angle into what it considered a more natural position but for me this was painful.  I did try elevating my wrist with a rest to try it out and it made it better but it is impractical for me to use my mouse this way long term.

I've extensively used the original MX Master as well as the MX Master 3. I *really* like the new 3S - the quiet buttons are fantastic!! I am heavy-handed and my Master 3 was really quite noisy during my day-to-day use. Even with my ogre hands, the Master 3S is - true to its claim - silent.The USB-C Charge port is also a great bonus - Most of my other peripherals use a C cable and now I no longer have to keep a micro-USB plugged in to charge my mouse.If you enjoy previous iterations of the MX Master, you'll love the 3S!!

Performs excellent. Slides around on my desk silky smooth. Great free-spinning scroll wheel (I already had that on my Performance MX mouse). They claim ""up to 70 days"" battery life, but mine is showing low after just 2-1/2 weeks. Although, I use the mouse many hours/day, so I suppose that's not too bad.But, there are a couple things I like better on my old Performance MX mouse -- 1) It fit my hand better. 2) The left & right buttons began way back at the center of the mouse, making them easier to click on even when I was using my fingertips to move the mouse around. (I know that one sounds strange, but sometimes I don't want the mouse seated all the way back into the palm of my hand. If I use my fingertips, I don't have to move my entire forearm, I just need to flex my fingers to move the pointer.)______________________________________12-06-2021 UPDATE:I've gotten really used to how this mouse feels. Now I like it better than my old Performance MX mouse. Go figure. I guess it's what you get accustomed to. If you're on the fence about upgrading, just do it, and your 'muscle memory' will adjust.Also, an update on battery life. I had to charge it today, and the last time I charged it was on 10-21-2021 (46 days ago). So, that's just over a 1.5 months. I can live with that. I use this mouse about 10-16 hours/day.

After having used this mouse for several weeks I can say it functions somewhat well. All the advertised functions work as expected other than the Flow feature (allowing one mouse to work on multiple computers).I have two computers, both on the same wired network. Each computer has the same USB-Bluetooth dongle. The problem lies somewhere within the mouse being able to detect screen edges. I have it set hold control (or any other key press) while moving the pointer to the edge which should allow the pointer to cross over. Unfortunately, if I get close to the edge the pointer will go over to the other screen/computer and interrupt my workflow. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. There's no pattern. Irritating, but I guess I'll live with it.

I had bought the MX master 3 and the MX keys keyboard for work and was so impressed that I bought another set for my house. The fact that I can connect to 3 different devices is great! The battery longevity is awesome, I use it at work for 8 to 10 hours a day and at home for about 4 to 6 hours a day. I can say that they both last about a month to a month and a half. The Logitech software lets you customize the buttons, even per application. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a productivity mouse.

Absolutely love this mouse, I started with logitech mouses way back in the day. They just keep getting better. I know they don't improve a whole lot at a time. Just wait one or two models too get a real big improvement. Awesome mouses. There are none better for pc's.

Picked this mouse up as soon as it was first released in September 2019 and have absolutely loved it ever since. The battery lasts forever, even with regular 40 hour a week use (about 3 months between charges). The button placement is all comfortable enough and feels so much nicer than cheap default mice in the hand. The left and right click are a little louder than I was hoping but it's not too much of a deal breaker. The advanced scroll wheel is very useful, so much so that I have a hard time using regular mice for any period of time since the free scrolling feature is very convenient, especially on win10 with Word documents.I use the three device feature very frequently, between personal computers and a work laptop while working from home. The Options software is great for expanding the usage of the mouse, especially reassigning functions or keypresses on the mouse, all on a per-program basis. Some light keyboard/mouse gaming is great with Options and this mouse to assign specific keypresses depending on the game.My work laptop doesn't allow for use of the Options software but despite that this mouse is still absolutely stellar for daily use. Sure, I can't use Options to allow me to use the side scroll wheel on Excel but that's not too big of a deal for me.Great mouse through and through, so much so that after using it for a year I decided to get MX Keys and the two together are amazing for work and personal use.Can't recommend this one enough. Just get it.

I just bought this mouse. I used it as is and didn't look for program updates. You must download the app/program To be able to customize and use to full potential. The mouse can be customized to specific programs . For example different buttons for micrsoft word vs internet explorer. You can use it while charging and while connected to the computer.  I use the bolt USB to connect it when I was customizing the mouse on the logitech program .  This is the first mouse i have bought with many functions. For 100$ I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep it but I will. I am enjoying it.

I’m a graphic designer, and go through a ton of mice. This one is the highest quality mouse I’ve used. I love that it can connect via bluetooth instead of USB, and works ACCURATELY on any surface without a mouse pad. Spend the extra money on this one and you’ll be glad you did.

Ok, let’s do some quick math. 14.359 reviews of which 95% gave it at least 4 out of 5 stars, which the vast majority (around 86%) gave it 5. I don’t quite understand why one reviewer that gave them 3 stars all because the dongle wasn’t type-c usb. Really?Definitely go with the majority in this case. That’s how I do all my PC/Mac related shopping- find the one with the most reviews AND at least 90% and up gave it 4-5 stars.This mouse is probably the best mouse I’ve ever owned. Using the dongle ensures a better connection (I haven’t even tried the Bluetooth connectivity). The software you download to customize the buttons/wheels is superb- easy to use and very intuitive while still offering plenty of tweaks. I hope this helps someone. I know I got my money’s worth.

The only nice thing about the Apple Magic Mouse is that it's included with the purchase of desktop machines. I've never liked the ergonomics of the Apple mouse and the fact that it can't be used while charging is just silly. The Logitech MX Master 3S solves both of those issues.

I was initially hesitant to purchase this mouse as my experience with Logi has been very, very inconsistent, however I needed a mouse for my home office that could hold up to 50+ hour work weeks and wouldn’t need replacement for several years. Since the media reviews as well as the reviews on here were extremely positive, I decided to chance it. A year later, I’m very, very glad I did. This may well be the last mouse you will ever need to buy. The angle at which you hold it make take some getting used to, as it is angled much less than some other ergonomic mice on the market, but it is comfortable to use for a ten-hour work day and definitely won’t go flying out of your hand accidentally. The internal battery will last you a good month, month and half at least if you power it off when not in use. The ability to pair to three devices is an awesome feature, and it works significantly better than I was expecting. The vertical scroll wheel is arguably this mouse’s party piece, and it is satisfying to watch it scroll for a good minute before the brake kicks in if you give it a good flick. If you really want to get the most you can out of this mouse, I would recommend installing Logi’s Logitech Options software as it offers some very nice customization options. That said, this is a solid mouse without the companion software, but the software adds a lot more value to it.

I guess you reach a certain age when you want tools that make work a little bit easier and more comfortable to facilitate. After seeing it recommended by Wirecutter I gave it a shot and they were right.Much easier to navigate and love the hidden features depending on the app (e.g., control music with thumb scroll).If you have the money, splurge and get this version than the more basic model.

* The mouse stutters like hell over plain Bluetooth connection* Logitech Options is the only way to truely ""Pair"" the device after the initial Bluetooth connection (and requires a second pointing device in the meantime)* To fix stutter issues, disconnect the mouse from Bluetooth and connect another mouse, then plug in the dongle (called ""Unifying receiver""), open Logitech Options and say ""Connect Device through Unifying Reciever"", then turn the device off then on again. You can now put away the other mouse and use this oneIf you bought this device because you wanted to free up a USB slot then I feel sorry for you. Simply put the mouse is nothing without the dongle, so you need the USB dongle plugged in. Otherwise the mouse will stutter so bad you will wish for something different. So yes, you can use one dongle to connect the keyboard and the mouse but you at least need the dongle. You cannot hardly use this over simple bluetooth.It is a good product with a nice design and feels good in the hands, but the connection issues are a little worrying for something that costs as much as this does. It's strictest competition is cheap, reliable USB dongle Keyboard and mouse combos that are plug and play so to have this not work over bluetooth and not work out of the box with the dongle surely means that this product will suffer in the general consumer market unless something is done to alleviate the connectivity issues.The stuttering is unbearable over bluetooth. Skip it and use the dongle. I was hoping to have 2 less things plugged into USB (mouse and keyboard) but now I just have one less USB connection (keyboard and mouse share) which really isn't that great of an improvement to be completely honest.Really anything in the with plug and play functionality is probably worth it. I like the ergo feel of this mouse and it has some cool features like the thumb wheel and gestures but it comes at the cost of being able to be set up out of the gate and for some reason requires a completely separate set of software acting as a middleman that completely blows my mind.For something in this price range you would really want it to be like 4.5 5 stars. Mouse and pointing technology has not matured past 20 years ago when I was using computers as a child. Turns out not much has changed it seems. So maybe turn your attention to something that will save you some money in the long run unless you will be using the daylights out of the sides croll and hotkeys feature.

I use this on PC and Mac. Scrolling is terrible and jittery on Mac, even with smooth scrolling enabled. I used an unverified app called Mos that worked pretty well but it's kind of a pain to switch on and off when I use other mice. It came with a unifying receiver, but I bought MX Keys Mini with Bolt. They are apparently incompatible and I have to use 2 dongles in my PC.  The mouse is much greyer in person than it appeared in the pictures. The horizontal wheel is pretty useless by default. You can switch tabs in the browser, which if you're like me you'll use more accidentally than on purpose. I've used a lot of Logitech mice and this is one of the least customizable. Not even a left/right click on the wheel. Logitech Flow software (for me anyway) is terrible. You fight and fight it to go to the other screen, then it slings and you can't find it. On Mac mission control and swiping between apps is a little wonky and feels a little homemade... but not completely terrible. The bottom scratches up within the first few hours of use (which is true with most or all Logitech mice.) AND THE MEGA KICKER: If you have a MX Keys keyboard you want to switch computer/devices, you need to push both the button on the mouse and the button on the keyboard in order to go from one computer to the next. There are people who have homebrewed a solution out there but it takes more reading/research/figuring out than I'm willing to go through.

Even with the scrolling not doing so well. Its still the best mouse money can buy for a Mac. I own a M1 iMac and I wanted a mouse over my trackpad for a long time but I also wanted the smooth apple scrolling. Well if you were hesitant to make that jump. do it. this mouse is Great. The scrolling is excellent when it works and when it doesn't work it still gets the job done to some extent. also the swipe gestures are also easily done on this mouse. and anything you want to do can be hot keyed to the mouse as well.5/5 would 100% recommend even with dodgy scrolling.

Update: I have enabled the FLOW function on the mouse to bounce back and forth between my laptop and desktop. I am floored by how well this works. No extra button presses, no fancy setup. I'm going to order a MX Keys keyboard now to further take advantage of this feature. Makes my desk and use of 2 computers so much more streamlined!I spent 19 years as a graphic designer, and always used whatever mouse that came with the mac workstations I had. Upon entering the Civil Engineering world, I splurged and purchased the MX Master 3 and oh man, I am so glad I did. The scroll wheel (with ratchet turned off) is so nicely weighted and smooth, and the buttons all fall under my fingers perfectly. I've mapped some of the buttons to specific keystrokes in Autocad to make my workflow faster and it has definitely helped. The battery life is great, giving me about 2 weeks of solid use before I need to plug in the USB C cable for an overnight charge. You can also use this mouse when it is plugged in and charging if you need to. I had no issues pairing it with a new Lenovo laptop and getting straight to work. Get this if you can afford it. I'm glad I did.

I decided to get an MX Master for my home gaming setup after using one for months at work. I absolutely love this mouse at work as it extremely comfortable and nice to use. I leave a shift of 8 hours of computer work with no wrist fatigue that one could experience with an OEM style mouse. That being said, the mouse is very heavy for any kind of fps gaming or anything where you need to be making quick movements. After an hour or so, my wrist was getting very tired and I ended up returning this to get a much lighter Mouse. If you are doing almost entirely productivity tasks, this is a must have. If you are mostly gaming, I would buy something lighter like a G502 or a Razer.

I got an office job for the first time in 7 years, and the first purchase I made was the Apple Magic Mouse. It's a sleek design, and the touch control is nice, but it leads to a very sore hand at the end of the day.This mouse is very comfortable, especially for someone with large hands. I do miss the touch control of the Magic Mouse, but this mouse makes up for it with comfort, build quality, and customizability. I do some video editing, and having all of the buttons is incredible. I set the left thumb button to Undo, the right thumb button to Blade, the bottom thumb button to Zoom with Scroll, and the small center button to Keyframe. Definitely speeds up the editing process to have access to some frequently used functions.I use this on a plastic faux wood desk top with no mouse pad and have never had issues with tracking after 4+ weeks.The scroll wheel unlocking seems gimmicky, but I actually like it. Line mode gives accurate scrolling, and free mode is nice to get to the bottom of a web page or document etc. Though when automatically switching from free mode to line mode while the wheel is turning it makes a slight buzzing sound. Might be annoying to some, or not suitable for all situations, but this automatic switching feature can be disabled to prevent that from happening.PROS:Very comfortable.Incredibly customizable. Buttons can be changed per app.The free scrolling is quite nice.It feels very premium.Very accurate.CONS:The scroll wheel makes a buzzing sound when switching from free scroll to line scroll while the wheel is turning.I basically recommend this to everyone in all situations, and will likely buy another one.

When it came time to replace an older Logitech wireless mouse, I initially was hesitant to spend this much money but I'm glad I did. For something that I use all day, 5 days a week, it's a luxury that just makes the workday easier. The double-wheel is fantastic for wide documents, really a nice feature, and the 'fast scroll' on the primary wheel works well too. (I've not tried to control more than one machine with it, so can't speak to that feature.)One thing to consider is it's on the large size as mice go, so if you have smaller hands I'd keep that in mind. I give it 4 out of 5 stars overall, but you may well find it 5-star. Recommended!

I wanted to like this mouse the clicker is super smooth but scrolling with this mouse is the worst out of every other mouse I have ever had. Some of the other reviews have the claim that the scroll function is the best? I am very confused and are they actually reviewing the same mouse? So sometimes when your scrolling it starts and stops scrolling which is super annoying. It is so weird b/c out of all the issues you might have with a mouse scrolling at least for me was never one of the issues. There is an extra scroll on the side that seems to be for back and forth scrolling which is nice in a superficial way and I hardly ever use that or find it very useful. I became sold on Logitech mice b/c of my last gaming mouse which was and still is awesome.  Should have bought another one of those but getting hard to find that older model and quite expensive but so it this one.  I am pretty disappointed overall.  I did see a handful of other reviews that said the same thing and worse but I did not listen since there were so many good reviews and I work in tech support.  My other mouse works perfectly on this computer but this one does not.

I'm finally upgrading from my MX Master 2S and wow. What an upgrade to an already stellar mouse that has stood the test of time. The upgrades to the scrollwheel alone make it worthwhile, but they've also improved the placement of the side buttons and made the left and right clicks incredibly quiet. They almost have to be heard to be believed. The sensor feels really smooth, even at just 125hz polling rate. I use 1000hz gaming mice most of the time so this was a nice surprise.Tested out gesture functionality on Windows and MacOS and it's great on both.Probably not worth upgrading if you have an MX Master 3 already, but definitely worth the upgrade if you've got a 2S or older.Highly recommend for work/productivity.

I love the shape of the mouse and how the fit just feels so natural.

By all accounts this is a great mouse, so I'm not going to knock it for my absurdly small hands. It didn't work at all for me, though -- with my hand in a comfortable palm-grip position, my fingers barely reached the scroll wheel and couldn't turn it without awkwardly shifting. I don't have this problem with the 2S, even though it's very similar). Most folks won't notice this, but if you have small hands and short fingers, make sure to get it from a seller who allows returns. And if you like the idea but can't use this one, finding the discontinued 2S might be worth a try.I can't speak to the long-term comfort of either mouse, but the 3 just wasn't usable out of the box for me.

Ive been using this thing for a month or so for just school work. Works awesome. Have not needed to charge it. The programmable buttons are WONDERFUL. I have the two thumb ones programed to copy and paste which saves so much time moving around notes and text. You can even program them to do different stuff in different apps. I use anki (Flashcard program)  a-lot, specifically the cloze cards. So I have a button that I programed to do the key stokes to ""cloze"" a piece of text when using the anki app. But it will do the normal function I programed in all other apps.I saw some people online say they didn't like how big and chunky it was and that it felt too big for their hand. but I have had no problem with that. (With my average sized female hands) Feels perfect to me, so maybe just a preference thing.Don't know anything about gaming so no idea how it works in that department!Only critique is that I feel like the sliding/switching windows gesture is not as smooth as I would wish. But it still works fine. I would also love to see them add a zoom wheel on the next version, but again, totally fine with out one. I just use my magic mouse pad for zooming into stuff.Anyways, 100$ is super expensive for a mouse, but its a solid buy if you are into having extra nice office gadgets with cool features! Logitech is always top notch.

This mouse is perfect for those who work from home or spend most of their day at their computer. The mouse feels extremely comfortable on the hand, the sensor is great, the battery life is long, and the button to switch between three different devices is amazing! On top of that, it charges through USB-C, making anyone's desk clear and clutter-free.

I have carpal tunnel from working with mice in the IT Industry for years. I researched and found that this could (and later would) be a solution for my aching hands.1. It fits great in your palm, the ergonomics are fantastic.2. Works great on Mac, never had a problem where it didn't immediately connect to my Mac Device on boot. Even when I had a software upgrade to Big Sur, recognized it immediately. Didn't have to worry about having to find a wired mouse to connect to my CPU to get past the login screen at all.3. The scroll wheel on top can be adjusted via the Logi Options application to increase or decrease the scroll speed. Also, if you can unlock the click detent by pressing on the button behind the wheel. I hate detents when I scroll, so a freewheeling scroll wheel does away with the annoying clicking sound as you scroll back and forth.Notes:To really support your wrists, get a Belkin mouse pad with wrist rest and place it down, put the mouse on it to operate. Your wrists will thank you.Logi Options application needs to be downloaded from the web. Make sure it is the Mac version. Once you install go to your security settings and all the Logitech application to control your mouse. This allows all the customization functions, and there are many, to work with many 3rd party applications. You will learn all about this in the Logitech application.

After reading a multitude of reviews and a dozen or so YouTube videos, I decided to pull the plug on the new MX 3.  The MX Keyboard is a staple in my Mac based studio where my private world revolves around graphic art, writing, and music composition, and my professional world around software engineering.  I spend 90% of my day with my hands on some form of controller.  I have enjoyed many Logitech devices over the years but this is my first foray into their higher end devices preferring Apple's magic trackpads in the past.To begin with, all the reviews are spot on concerning the MX 3, it is an amazing device.. however, the ergonomics did not fit my Medium hands.  As a pianist and guitarist my hands have an abnormal amount of reach compared to many but my index finger just could not fully reach, cover, or comfortably operate the MX3's main scrolling wheel.  In short, the height of the palming area of the mouse is too high for me.Yes, the MX3's all steel wheel and magnetic feedback are better than the 2S, but aside from the heftier weight, I preferred the position of the main scrolling wheel as well as all the buttons on the 2S including the placement and composition of the thumb scroll.  I chose to disengage the ratcheting feedback on the 2S and personally love it.Ergonomically the 2S is far better for my particular hands.  The 2S is slightly shorter in height and slightly wider in width.  My farthest right 2 fingers have more to rest and hold onto compared to the MX3, and strangely I also found the bottom left button and left buttons alongside the horizontal thumb scroll wheel were better placed for my needs.  The MX3's approach of the left ""fwd""/""bwd"" buttons are a better concept but their placement was just not correct for me.Although this review is as much about the MX2S as for the MX3, I had a hard time finding many reviews covering both.  Hope this helps someone.I also purchased the new Anywhere 3 and also love it.. in fact I may find that I actually prefer it, time will tell :D.

I strongly dislike trackpads so carry a mouse in my computer bag; and I also use mice when I'm connected to the docking stations at my office-office and my home-office.  Because I like gadgets, I try new keyboards and mice often.  This is simply the best mouse I've ever used - and the only thing close was its predecessor version.  Things I love about it:  extraordinarily comfortable for someone with big hands (however, it's right-handed only); rechargeable battery and long battery life; its ability to track perfectly on surfaces that a traditional optical mouse would have difficulty with (like clear glass tables and shiny surfaces); the fact that I never need a mouse pad; great Bluetooth connection which obviates the need for the USB dongle (it comes with one, but you don't really need it); the Logitech Options software that lets you control literally every imaginable thing about the mouse, its buttons and behavior; and the smoothness of the scroll wheel between the left/right buttons (although I prefer to have ""SmartShift"" disabled).  It's expensive for a mouse, but 100% worth it.

Best Mouse I have ever used, BUT lack software on Linux makes it only a 3 Star mouse in my book.I have purchased two of these mice.  DO NOT get the white version of the mouse if you expecting it to stay white.  After a month of use in my office, My super white mouse looks rather gross.  I can see a lot of dirt and other stuff from discoloring on the soft white surface.  See my included pictures to see the dirt/dis-colorization that I am talking about.There is not Options+ software on Linux.  So don't expect to change program buttons on this mouse even though Logitech calls this a ""Developer Mouse"".  If they had provided some kind of linux software for the MX Master 3S, it would have been a grand slam for me.  I did not have any problems connecting the mouse with my Ubuntu 22.04 desktop with the wireless connector.  BUT there is no way to program or change the mouse buttons.

Pro's- More features than any other mouse (forward/back buttons, gesture button, 2 scroll wheels)- Smooth scrolling is good but it doesn't feel nearly as good as magic mouse or magic trackpad scrolling- ErgonomicCon's- Customization requires the logitech software which is generally reliable but buggy enough to cause aggravation (it crashes too often which breaks the mouse until software is restarted)- The level of customization in the logitech software is not sufficient. I want the ability to add modifier keys (eg forward/back button behavior would be modified by pressing command key).- Gesture button cannot be customized with external software like BetterTouchTool- Customization is local to the computer. You can tweak the mouse to get the sensitivity exactly right, but when you switch to another computer, you need to reinstall logitech options and redo your settings for each machine. It'd be great if the mouse could store your preferences on the device itself just like high-end keyboards.- It's very expensive. I haven't found it especially better than the $20 mouse I was using before. The only major difference is smooth scrolling and I don't think that's worth the $80 premium when I could buy a magic trackpad for that price.

Thank you Logitech for the quiet clicks! I’ve been waiting years for this one and you guys delivered. Love this mouse even more now. The clicks used to be way too loud for me personally when focusing quietly in design software

This mouse feels solid and comfortable to the hand. It’s responsive on Bluetooth but I haven’t used it with usb.The mouse has lots of buttons but doesn’t look gimmicky.What I wish this mouse would improve on is how a user selects a different device to use the mouse in. Currently in order to switch the mouse to another device, you have to turn the mouse over and select a button which toggles between 1,2 and 3 selections. It would be best if if the device selector was located at the top or side of the mouse. Having to switch becomes frustrating lifting turning over selecting a device.

If you are on the fence about this mouse, just get it. I have been using a $35 logitech for over 10 years, and this is amazing. If you are interested in having software with customized gestures and buttons for each application, as well as a really comfortable professional mouse, this is for you.If you spend most of your day at your desk, like me, just get it already.

This is the first mouse I've seen that had a virtually inaudible button click, but still good tactile feedback.  These are relatively large/heavy mice if that's a factor for you; I couldn't see it as a gaming mouse.

This mouse has a very nice, contoured shape for right-handed users.  I cannot imagine using it if you are left-handed, however. There is a textured rubber encasing most of the mouse which took me a couple of days to adapt to but now that I have, I enjoy using the mouse and enjoy the functionality of the scroll wheel on the left side of the mouse.My biggest concern however with this mouse is that the rubberized texture will eventually become sticky and unusable if other rubberized devices I have had over the years, Logitech Mice as well, are any indication. This texture covers a good 75% of the mouse top surface.

This is by far the best mouse I have ever owned. When I saw the price tag initially I was a bit skeptical. How good can a wireless mouse possibly be, right? Boy was I wrong. I love the hybrid-ergonomic shape, very comfortable. It is a great starter mouse for someone like me who has used a standard mouse for their entire life and isn't ready to go fully sideways/ergonomic yet. The mouse wheel is absolutely gravity-defying. It is practically zero friction, it will just keep spinning and spinning! It makes scrolling on large webpages and excel documents so much easier. The wheel is completely silent too, which is nice. It also has excellent battery life. I have had to charge it 3 times in the 4 months I have owned it, and I probably could have waited longer in between. I don't use the customization features much, but I'm sure they are great for those who have use for them. My only complaint is that the Logitech program/drivers may cause some computer issues for some. For example, when I try to shut down my computer I sometimes get an error popup regarding the Logitech overlay still being active. There is also a Bluetooth-related part of the drivers/application that invisibly pops up on the computer at random times which can minimize and interrupt what I am currently doing, which can be frustrating. Overall I love this mouse, and would highly recommend it to everyone.

I am a first time adopter. I haven't owned the previous versions of this mouse so these are my initial thoughts.Pros: The scrolling is very satisfying. The ergonomics is also great. I come from ""designer"" mouses such as the Surface Arc and also the Apple Magic Mouse 2. These mouses began to give me wrist problems and it also tired out my fingers a lot. This mouse fits very well in my hands and I don't feel that it will give me any problems.There are reviewers who have said that there is jitter. I am running macOS Catalina 10.51.1 and have zero jitter. Also, there are reviewers who are concerned about input monitoring ""from your keyboard""; I'm fairly certain that macOS Catalina's improved security mechanisms are at play here. I believe that this needs to be enabled in the security settings because of the extra mouse buttons which can be registered as key strokes (such as the gesture button and wheel mode shift which can be modified). Some apps from Apple themselves warn with certain permissions as well.Cons: Like others, it's a bummer that the receiver is still not USB-C. It is especially inconvenient with modern MacBooks that need dongles to use USB 2 or 3. This led me to use bluetooth so at least it won't be that inconvenient.Another thing I noticed is that it is hard to rest my finger on the scrolling wheel; web pages move very subtly so I assume it is very sensitive, even in ratchet mode. Maybe my device is defective, so I'll exchange it to see if that's the issue.The other issue I have is that the only way to view the battery status is to use their application.

Aside from my old Kensington 12-button trackball, this has been my favorite mouse/trackball device. I work in video game audio development and spend long hours across multiple computers using software running on macOS and Windows. This mouse has not let me down in any way. Over the past year after many hours per day, this mouse does not negatively affect my wrist as so many others have. I find it very comfortable. The battery life is great. I can get about 4-6 weeks out of it before needing a charge and when I do need to plug it in, I can continue to use it since the port is on the front. I wish that the port on the mouse was micro USB but it's not a deal-breaker.I didn't have high expectations for the multi-computer features but in my experience it actually works and is very useful when I need it. I did have one small issue where the mouse would pass from my Mac's secondary monitor to my Windows laptop but it would not return from Windows to macOS. After that issue disappeared (a few reboots of every device involved seemed to fix it), I was able to successfully copy files across and then control three different computers, two running Windows and one Mac.

When I took an ergonomics course in grad school, I learned that it can actually be detrimental to have a tool that is overly molded to the grip of a particular hand shape, as it can lock your hand into a particular position, where it can cramp, exacerbate repetitive motions, etc.  That said, I've been a long time user of Logitech's MX mice, starting with the MX Performance that had the same general hand shape as this MX Master 3.  There have been subtle changes over the years.  If they still made the original MX Performance, I think I'd still prefer to use that one.  The MX Master 3 still has the same feel though, and I like the weight of the mouse and its roller cam scroll wheel.  So I keep going back to this family of mice.

I was looking for a new mouse for my at home office set up, and have always went with Logitech for my needs. Have owned various mice from low end to high end, these were tough to find in stock at the time of purchase and are pretty pricy. I work in the architecture space drawing plans in 2d/3d, the more comfortable and efficient that a mouse can be is definitely a plus. So after seeing reviews on the multi task features and versatility I decided to buy it. In the past I  have used a Performance MX mouse and thought it may be an upgrade.After receiving it I was impressed with the feel and functionality. Very quick to set up and having Bluetooth is a huge plus as you don’t have to worry about a usb connection. However, after a few days I found it to be to bulky for me and I kept accidentally clicking the back button. Changing it in settings to have that button be no function didn’t help. It unfortunately wasn’t as ergonomic as expected and needs a few redesign touches, I ended up returning. Purchased the Performance MX instead, much more comfortable mouse for me, it may not have all the fancy bells and whistles but comfort is my #1 concern for a mouse.Overall Master 3, recommended for people with larger hands but not really great for users with average size hands.

I've been using Logitech mice since the three-button corded Mouseman--I still use--I use 2-to-3 mice at one time.  In addition to the Mouseman corded, I use a VX Revolution and a VX Nano mouse--USB mice.  I needed a Bluetooth mouse for my new iPad, ergo I got this mouse.I listened to a reviewer who recommended the MX Master 3 with the Unifying Receiver rather than the Apple version of the same mouse--because it would function with Apple and yet include a USB dongle for other use.  He was absolutely correct--it still worked totally with the iPad and could work with my Windows PC with the USB Receiver.  So why get the Apple version only.My VX Revolution  has 10 programmable buttons, the VX Nano has 8 buttons, and this MX Master 3 has multiple programmable buttons as well, which was what attracted me.  The feel is good, and it is very easy to use, with greater precision--almost as precise as the corded Mouseman.I am able to switch between three devices, my Windows PC, the iPad and another.  Works out really well.  This $100 mouse is worth it.  Get a case to protect it.  I am using it more with my Windows PC than the iPad, what it was initially intended for.

I try to avoid wireless devices when possible to avoid battery maintenance. But, this is a pretty good mouse for work. I've only noticed a tracking or wireless signal glitch once where the mouse would lag a bit. I've only had to charge it once in the couple months. I've been using it for work 8hrs/day. It's perfectly usable while charging, unlike that stupid Apple mouse.Most importantly to me, the fairly aggressive slant prevents the wrist pain I was getting from the small Dell mouse I was using.

I like this mouse, I own two of them, and I did replace two MX Master 2s with them. However, after months of use of the first, and weeks of use of the second, I can say that they are not much better than the MX Master 2s.  Sure the scrolling speed is amazing, and it is not to terribly uncomfortable, however they should have added an extra notch to rest an extra finger on. I got used to the backward and forward commands on my 2s, I do not find this one that much easier, but if you are not used to the 2s you will find the backward and forward commands much easier.I like the feel of the mouse, although I wish you could put more of your hand on it. The backward and forward buttons are better if you are not already used to the 2s, and charging with a C Cable improves charging time dramatically. It switches between computers better than my old 2s, but they still did the job. However, it also has way better tracking than my 2s on odd surfaces that are not my desk, like my leg, or bed.In the end it is an improvement on what was already a very good mouse. If your employer is going to pay for the upgrade then jump all over it. However, if you have to shell out 100 dollars on a mouse, and you have the previous model, you already have a great mouse, and you may be dissappointed that this model is only a slight improvement.

I have bought and thrown out many Logitech mouses. This one is going in the trash after 6 months for same reason as the rest: The left button fails requiring multiple taps to make a connection, over and over and over again.Apparently they use the same cheap, fragile, crummy, little micro switch in all of their mouses which simply wears out, quickly, whether the mouse cost $10 or $100, like this one.Meanwhile, I have found overall this mouse is just too big for my hand and the scroll wheel, as usual , wears my right index finger raw from using it daily.  I wish I could find a truly perfect mouse. I have an Apple Magic Mouse for backup. Where the Logitech is too big, the Apple is too small and the ergonomics are wanting. Etc.Anyone know of a truly good mouse not buried in marketing dept. hyperbole?

Logitech makes terrific products. And I have been buying them for years. My last mouse lasted so many years that I almost didn't upgrade to this new one.

Has easy to use features (and I am over 50 years old). And it is virtually silent. I work at home -- all day and all night -- and this mouse is terrific and virtually silent. Well worth the price.

The mouse is great, and the features are fantastic. If you're picking up an MX master it should be for the features.The main scroll wheel is great (but you have to tune the sensitivity just right for your hand)The side scroll wheel is great in excel (although I wish you could freely spin it like the main scroll wheel)The gesture button is a powerhouse that I use far more than I would have assumed.Program-specific gestures and buttons has been such a huge improvement.The polling rate is quite noticeable if you try and do anything more than business oriented work, but having the dongle does improve latency slightlyThis works flawlessly with my MacBook and windows pc. I would recommend this version to anyone with a Mac since the Mac version doesn't come with the dongle!Finally.. the ergonomics. Frankly my least favorite part. I find the MxMaster 2 far more comfortable because you can use it like a normal mouse. I think the problem is the thumb rest being too low compared to the MX master 2 that snugly fit your thumb.  the hump of this mouse is snug but I find myself struggling in the learning curve to get accustomed to it. It took a little while and I can now use it for long periods of time.

Most reviews and answered questions on this item are about the (no longer available) MX Master 3, not the MX Master 3S.This review is about the new MX Master 3S. As a mouse, it is very good, but there are other very good mice for far less money.I am very dissatisfied with this mouse. I have two of the older discontinued version (3) that work very well. The problem with the new model (3S) is that it doesn't work with the ""unifying"" receiver that comes with K860 keyboard. This renders the multi-system functionality useless for my purpose. This was not a problem with the discontinued MX Master 3.

This mouse is great out of the box, but if you’re able to install the software you can set the additional buttons to do just about anything you want. It’s a good size for most hands and is angled to take pressure off your wrist. I sit at a computer for work for 8-12 hr/day 5-6 days a week and it’s done wonders for the fatigue/pain I was seeing in my wrist. A little pricey and there’s probably cheaper options that are just as good for the average computer user but if you work in an office and spend more time than not in front of a computer it’s well worth it in my opinion

I really, really wanted to like this mouse.  It fits my hand like a glove, and I love the extra buttons, having just come from a very basic USB mouse.  It had such a nice hand feel, and although the thumb button is pretty useless as it's very difficult to press without pushing the mouse all over the place, I can live without it, especially since I can't map that button as I'll describe below. Also, the battery life is quite good.  I think I can generally get about 2 weeks or more on a full charge, using the mouse for probably 12 hours per day. The scroll wheels are fairly good, with a decent response, though I do see some odd jitter and lag from time to time, and the position of the thumb scroll wheel can be a bit awkward.But, that is, unfortunately where my joy for this mouse ends.  First, it's not a Linux mouse, despite the claim.  Yes, after plugging it into a Linux system, the pointer moves around and the buttons work (this is not unique as the protocols for basic mouse functionality work in pretty much any modern Linux kernel, and you should be able to pretty much plug any mouse you find in and have it work at this level).  But, the software designed to accompany the mouse and allow to to adjust the functionality, button mapping to applications, monitor the battery, etc. can not be installed on Linux, and you have to try to find some other 3rd party hacks as a surrogate. So, for example, I can not map the thumb button to anything, and am stuck with it in the default action, which is to swap between open applications like an Alt + Tab keyboard shortcut.  But, if you don't care about knowing the battery level and mapping the buttons to your liking, I guess that's not a big deal?Worse, the connectivity, whether it be though the WiFi or Bluetooth connection is awful.  I am constantly having dropouts, lag, and inconsistent responsiveness that is beyond frustrating.  This mouse is not at all, in any way, shape, or form usable for gaming.  And, even for just general office work, it can be maddening to have it jumping around while you're trying to cut and paste data in a spreadsheet, or click on the correct link in a webpage.  About 75% of the time it may work fine - even, arguably great.  But, then, for some unknown reason, it will just start flaking out and be useless for the next few hours.  I still have my 10 year old basic USB mouse connected just so that I can swap over to that when the mouse feels like flaking out.This mouse is expensive, and as such, I would have expected a much, much better user experience and performance.  It seems as though, many other users are seeing the same thing based on the reviews.  So, hopefully Logitech will figure out what's going on and either release a patch to correct the bad behavior (along with a supported Linux application!), or send out a better unifying receiver or something to address the spotty connectivity.In short, save your money and look for a more reliable and better built mouse, as this one is not nearly worth the cost.  And, if you are running Linux and want a full native experience, don't believe the claim on the box that it's a Linux mouse - it's not.

To date I've owned the each iteration of the MX mice. They get better overall with each iteration, but each iteration also has it's missteps. The MX 3 is no exception, it's the best one yet.Positives:* Easy to set up with nice configuration options.* Comfortable to use.* Moved the forward and back buttons back to under the horizontal scroll wheel. (So glad they moved back to this the location on the MX 2 was terrible)* Auto-magic switch between infinite and step scrolling. Loved this feature from the MX 2 and it's only been made better.* Uses USB-C now!* All metal scroll wheels. Easier to clean and don't show wear like MX 2. In addition the horizontal scroll while is bigger and easier to use.Cons:* Got rid of the battery charging status from MX 2. Now it's just a single LED, so it's harder to tell when fully charged.* Can't switch the computer the mouse is controlling from Logitech Options. (This should be added, it's so convenient with the MX Keys to do this.)* Could be slightly larger, this would improve the ergonomics for myself but likely hurt others. (Can't win them all.)

The mouse is extremely good. The roller is very satisfying. The three buttons on the thumb have totally eliminated the need for Ctrl+c or v.If you are loooking for a mouse for work, this is it.

The MX Master 3s is very similar to the older MX Master 3, as far as I can tell, except that the MX Master 3s has a much quieter button click (probably useful in work settings), and comes with the Logi Bolt dongle (yet another dongle).  Instantly works with the included dongle, and pairing with another laptop was simple.

The mouse wheel functionality is the best. It's clicky if you want it to be and free spinning if you want it to be. Easy to switch.

I fell in love with the original MX Master 3. We have two in our house and now that I am back in the office, I ordered another mouse, this time the MX Master 3s given it looked to be an upgrade and the non ""S"" version was out of stock. The 3s feels numb with less tactile buttons and thumb wheel feels like its rolling through something sticky (think molasses) . As a result I am double clicking unintentionally. I use the MX keys (non-mechanical) so I'm not the person who usually wants incredibly positive feedback or overly tactile response, but the current feel is just too vague. Mouse looks great and the function you get from it is still well beyond other mouses.

The last mouse I bought was 7 years ago and I had no idea how far mouse technology has come or I would've upgraded a long time ago. The gesture feature to work on macs is awesome, I'm finally able to get rid of my extra track pad. The side scroll wheel is fantastic and been long needed for photoshop and filmstrip work but even the features for something as simple as chrome is awesome. Being able to change its functions for different programs is just so useful. I could go on and on about this mouse but I hope this enough to convince you that you are in the right place.

This mouse is a great improvement over the 2S. The 2 has a very loud and distinct click. In an office environment where you sit in lots of meetings having a mouse that makes no sound on the click is a huge improvement. No one can hear anything. The mouse is super responsive on Bluetooth or usb.

WARNING:  I have been using this mouse since Christmas (less than 4 months) and I'm actively looking to find its replacement.The scroll wheel is entirely inconsistent.  Sometimes it scrolls one line at a time (rarely). Other times it's 10 lines or even whole pages go flying by.  There is also a lag when you use it.  It behaves differently on each piece of software, and it really freaks out if you use anything other than windows (like a virtualization window, for example).  The DPI on the mouse itself is not adjustable; everything is done via software, which gives it a strange feel.  Also, when windows first boots up your mouse will be soooooo slow until the supporting software loads.  In the bios: slow as hell.  In non-windows (Linux): also slow as hell.  The DPI must be VERY LOW on this mouse.There are videos online about how to take it apart and fix the scroll wheel, but when I pay $100 for a mouse I shouldn't have to do repairs on it frequently.  (the fix is temporary, so they suggest you leave the screws out since you'll be doing the repair a lot).The left mouse button struggles on dropdowns in every web browser I've tested.  It will drop down the selections and close them back up you will wonder if it ever opened to begin with.  Which will lead you to clicking it again... and again... and again like Russian Roulette until you win the prize of that click leaving the dropdown open.  It's a blast on every online order with a state dropdown.  (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Brave & Safari tested).It honestly feels like someone is pulling a gag on you when you use this mouse.  Yes, it's big, but I have no complaints about the size or ergonomics.  I like the thumb rest and the thumb scroll wheel is a welcome and clever addition that scrolls a bit slow, but at least it's consistent, so I have no complaints.  The battery life is amazing, and it charges VERY FAST.  I use it all day, and rarely do I need to charge it, and when I do, it's ready to rock for weeks on less than an hour's charge.  Perhaps it's the big battery that makes it heavy.  So heavy that if you use finger placement at 131 you will probably need to change to 122  as your pinky will struggle after hours of use, or you'll start accidentally right-clicking as you pull the mouse.I've been working on PCs since they first came out (8086, 8088, and my first build of a 286 (Commodore Amiga & 64 before that), and during those four decades, I've used hundreds of mice and many of them have been made by Logitec (my mouse before this one was a Logitech) and I can say with 100% certainty that this is the most frustrating mouse I have ever used in all my life.The negative feelings I have for the performance of this mouse borderlines on hate.

I had no idea how out of touch I was with electronics. This mouse has 7 programable buttons. Ya ever watching a video at night and its volume is set for voice, then all of a sudden it blasts bass rap music 5 times louder and wakes the whole house before you can turn it down. Almost every video. I don't game so I don't want an official gaming mouse. I was able to program volume on the Horizontal wheel for volume and mute on the scroll wheel. Forward and back buttons. There's so many choices for each button you don't know which one to assign. If you do office work its a no brainer. The app makes it easy as pie to change buttons.

I am a 55-70 hours per week desk jockey at an engineering firm. I spend 90% of my day elbows deep in 2D and 3D CAD programs. I have been using the MX series for years now. I am lucky enough my company with provide these for me when I ask for them. I could ask for any brand or model and they would provide it, but I choose the MX Master 3 and MX Keys. I usually charge the mouse on the weekends, yes it lasts that long. The MX Keys needs charged twice a week since I leave the auto key illumination on. The feature I love most is being able to switch between three systems. Because you can connect via Bluetooth to your laptop, you can connect to multiple devices that have Bluetooth enabled. I have three laptops at my home office (COVID Protocol), my company laptop, my client’s provided laptop (I am contracted out to my client, so they provide a laptop to make working in their systems easier), and my personal laptop. The keyboard and mouse have a button labeled 1-2-3. Just select the one you want and go to work. I can swap on the fly when I need to.

I got the MX Master 3s a few weeks ago, and I absolutely love it. I have never used a mouse that I love more than this one. I love the deep white color and it matches my desk setup perfectly. The clicks are nice and quiet. I love the customization of this mouse in the logo options app. It gives great control over the mouse. I paired this mouse with the new MX mechanical keys. Love it overall!

All of this is subjective, but this mouse is not as comfortable for me as the previous ones I have owned (MX Revolution, Performance MX, Master 2S). The arch is much higher (it seems to get higher with each iteration), so if you like to keep your palm flatter, you'll have to adapt a bit. I personally think the Master/Master 2S design is the most comfortable for me, but YMMV. HOWEVER, out of the box, the scroll wheel sensitivity seems to match exactly what I am looking for. Previous models have never quite detected when I was trying to scroll fast vs slow, and I would overcompensate to force it into glide mode, making it pretty useless. The tactile feedback on the scroll is more subtle than the 2S... I would compare it to the Performance MX, but at this point its so old the Performance might just be worn out. I'm glad they went back to the front/back buttons for forward and back instead of the over/under on the Master series... it was closer to where my finger was, but it wasn't quite clear which I was pressing and I did so with trepidation. I bought this to replace my home mouse with the intention of bringing the 2S to work, but since most of my scrolling is data at work, I may be forced to bring this fancy new mouse into the office.

The MX Master 2 was a game-changer for someone who spends a LOT of time in spreadsheets, CAD, and coding. Ratchet -> freewheel = awesome! Due to experiencing the known issue of the gesture button getting stuck, I ordered a MX3. Somehow it's better in almost every way.Pro: The wheel is heavier and more responsive. The thumb wheel likewise. USB-C is great (for me). The battery apparently draws energy from an alternate dimension. The app-specific button assignments are great (but not the defaults; you'll want to change those).Con: The back/forward buttons seem ill-placed (relative to MX2), but I have large hands, so maybe they're great for normal folks. Similarly, I wish it were bigger overall, with more force needed to click the main buttons. Sometimes the connection gets laggy, even with all the networking tweaks (ask Google) that make it tolerable. The Options software still wants to update too often, though has gotten better.Haven't tried Flow on it, but assume it's as good as the MX2. If you're deciding whether you need a fancy-pants mouse, you definitely do, and it's the best $100 you'll spend on an accessory.Bonus Pro: Easy fix for the MX2 (ask YouTube) put a great - if a little worn - mouse in my mobile office.

I've never been one to splurge on a mouse but after my last one died I decided I wanted something with better quality.  This mouse has a great feel with both the grip and the scroll wheel.  At first I didn't know what to expect with the magnetic scroll wheel but I am very impressed.  It is indexed during normal operation but then when you scroll faster it switches to a totally smooth roll.  However, if you prefer a smooth scroll all the time there is a button to switch over.  I was also skeptical about a rechargeable mouse but this one lasts weeks (use of 1-2 hours per day).I haven't found the additional scroll wheel on the side to be very useful.  In MS Word the zoom is very glitchy and in Chrome it moves through the tabs way too fast.  I personally don't miss much from not using this extra wheel which is why I leave it at 5 stars.  Highly recommend, especially to business professionals.

I can't hear the mouse clicks... ...and it's weird... Also, the scroll wheel is super quiet... ...and that's weird too... It makes 0 noise when gliding on the mouse pad... It's like it's not even there, which is weird... But cool!!! I like it!

I took the leap and got the MX Mouse. I LOVE it. I've had it for a few months now, and have only had to charge it once. I also went ahead and got the case for it and it's the best thing I could've done. I clip it to my bag and I ALWAYS have it with me. It connects to desktop, to my surface, and to my laptop. The ONLY complaint I have is that I wish the programming worked on my computer at work (without having to download Logi software - I have a government computer and they're strict). Also, to make it easier in the next model, the switching between devices button should be more accessible. It's not difficult to get it to it, but it could be easier to switch between my devices without having to flip over the mouse.

Just bought a third one of these since I am giving them to my kids, too. Great mouse and very comfortable, too.With this latest one my daughter was having some issues and I told her to pull up the logitech unifying software to pair the mouse. It didn't work.It didn't work because the receiver is not a unifying receiver - it is a ""bolt"" receiver.These are apparently new and improved, but naturally they are not backwards compatible, so if I happen to have a keyboard compatible with a unifying receiver I'm back to having two USB receivers.I'm not against improvements, but having ""not compatible with unifying receiver"" suddenly inserted into the product description in very small print leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Three stars for that, even though I give the product five in general.

Update:I ordered a different Bluetooth dongle by Avantree as a last minute Hail Mary and it has resolved all my issues!!!!This is amazing to me because my other Bluetooth devices, ear buds etc worked fine with my previous adapter. I wish there was a better rating system or quality control on Bluetooth adapters. Reviews are deceiving, my first adaptor got good reviews as well.Old:It connects via Bluetooth straight away, but disconnects often.  I have to disable and re-enable my Bluetooth to get it to connect and work again.  Which means I have to keep a second mouse connected just so that I can reconnect this mouse when it fails.  I don't think it's worth it!!!!!  A mouse is only good if it actually works.I read one that said to disable the logitech download assistant which is loaded as a device.  When you do this the middle button no longer works - so for me that is not a solution.  LIke most big companies Logitech has gotten away from customer support in favor of letting their customers support each other.  So I will probably return this.  So sad.

This is a great mouse for business/home use. The optional free spinning scrolling wheel is perfected really well on this one including on Web pages which in the past with earlier versions could be a problem. It can have a little delay when first moved after sitting idle for a bit. That doesn't cause me any problems for non gaming applications. I've never tried to game with it. I doubt that would be a good functional fit for it, at least where timing is critical.

After much research I bought the MX Master 3 and after a few months of use I have the following takeaways:PROS:- Wireless and holds charge for at least a week after using 5hr per day AND USB-C!- Sleek and very comfortable/ergonomic. I really appreciate the heavier weight.- Bluetooth connectivity is reliable and switches fast and reliably between Windows, iOS, and Android.- Free spin scrolling feature is addictingly useful. I miss it when using other mice.- The side scroll and forward/back buttons are well placed and usefulCONS:- The mouse keep charge by shutting off when not in use (that's good), but the mouse takes about a second to turn back on when I start to use it again after a pause. The pause is noticeable, but not enough to make me use any other mouse.OF NOTE: I use Bluetooth on my Windows machine and when I accidentally turn off Bluetooth - which I do fairly often - I'm left with no connection to turn it back on (my keyboard is BT too) funny, but noteworthy.

I ended up returning the mouse. Mainly due to connectivity issues causing lag and stutter, but also because it's just a HUGE mouse. Why is the hump in the middle so great and the mouse so long? I am 6' and 220 pounds, I have pretty good size hands, and I found this a very awkward and big mouse. I think for it's design, it deserves a rest on the right side too for your palm. The way you hand sits on the mouse and the way they designed it, your palm really drags on that side. Anyways...Obviously, it's not a gaming mouse. I am NOT a competitive gamer and even I found it pretty awful during gaming - even on games like RDR2. It's just too slow and even if you download the logi software and increase dpi to 8k. Also, it's ANOTHER piece of logitech software. What are we up to now... 18? I have like 6 different logitech mice and each one has a different unifying software. Old ones, new ones... doesn't matter. The most recent of all of them, the unifier and software is different.I am assuming this is why a lot of people are having connectivity issues across the board with Logitech products? Because it's not just this mouse.On the positive side, I did love the build quality, the quiet clickers and the color options. I would absolutely enjoy this mouse if it had a palm rest on that right side because it tilts your hand to that side a little, it's necessary. I did not enjoy the scroller on this mouse, but I could have learned to live with it. I prefer the option of a physical click between infinite scroll and traditional. It's smoother and quicker. It felt like I was lifting weights trying to scroll a website with the MX 3S. Every scroll felt so heavy!My big question is ""why not both?"". Why not give us the good Lightspeed connection and same software that comes with those products with an expensive productivity mouse? Why not give us that ""gamer"" reliability in both connection and high DPI quality in a mouse designed the ""ergo"" way? Why can't we have it both ways? If you took this mouse and combined it with a G604 - you would have the perfect hybrid mouse ever:Tactile click, but silent.Great scrolling with the manual option for infinite scroll.A small amount of programmable buttons that are not intrusive or ""gamery"".An ergonomic designLightSpeed connection and software integration - also ability for a unifier to adopt a new peripheral.These are what we need to both be productive and have fun. Make us a hybrid please.

I work full time on both Mac/Windows laptops now and really started despising the ergonomics of Magic Mouse (MM2) . The shape and size of the Apple MM I think Apple must use children's hands to design mice. This Logitech mouse fits my hand well in a more natural position for my hand and thumb and stopped all the hand cramping and arm pain from using the required crab-pincer grip with the MM. While I miss the built in functionality of the MM that Apple won't share, the Logitech has a side scroll and a hefty scroll wheel for verticle scroll with a free scroll too. The side scroll is nice on the Apple MM and the It works with The triple multi device swap is nice though I wish they could move the device swap button to the top somewhere. The USB-C charge port is in the front not underneath like Apple's ""innovative"" underneath port which renders the mouse useless until you can get enough charge to get by. Overall I'm glad to have switched and relagated the MM to selling to someone else.

Look at the support community at Logitech for this mouse. You'll see a consistent problem with the scroll wheel and less often the mouse pointer itself just quitting working for a few seconds.I had the problems.  Support was only via email, so it took days to get the several round trips to try and resolve. They finally suggested updating the USB and Bluetooth drivers on the PC.  That fixed most, but not all, of the problems.  Logitech opted to send me a new mouse. Same problems with it.I am baffled that Logitech's mouse doesn't work with drivers on a laptop that is less than 2 years old.  What about backwards compatibility?Other than the above, the mouse (when working) is great!PROS: - Great feel in the hand. - Scroll function (that accelerates for faster scrolls as you spin the control) is super for scrolling through large datasets. - Ability to use the mouse in both Bluetooth and with the Logitech dongle is a great feature. - Ability to use the mouse with 3 separate systems is great! (Small button on the bottom to select.) - USB-C charging is nice, and the battery is decent.  (Not as good as the alkaline mice I've had in the past, but much better than the chargeable mouse I replaced - I am a heavy user and have to charge every 4-5 days. - New management software allows for much more customization (even by program), albeit it's not as intuitive as one would like.  Took some trial and error to change things.CONS: - See failure discussion above. - No user-accessible battery compartment. So when that rechargeable battery goes (typically by not holding a charge very long), I'll be forced to buy a new mouse or take my screwdriver to it. - Logitech support quality is low. Ability to identify a solution to a common problem (just look at the support community) isn't there, and the email process is way too slow.In short, I recommend this mouse IF you are willing to immediately return it if it doesn't work. Don't bother with Logitech support.

The mouse is more then what I hoped for. It connects to multiple computers and easily transfers/ copies/pastes files between different computers. I used to send files by email to my other computers - now I just drag them over. One mouse for multiple computers and seamless transfer of the mouse pointer between the different screens. Highly recommend. There are issues with bluetooth even when using a dongle. But one posting addressing this problem stated putting the dongle close to one of the screens - this has totally resolved the lagging issue of the pointer and I have nt had any issues since.

As a general mouse, it's brilliant. The shape, the design, the buttons, construction, all excellent. The scroll wheel doesn't rattle like the MX2.When it comes to the fancier features like Flow and customizability, it's disappointing. It feels like there are some major oversights from Logitech, like not allowing you to remap the multi-device button TO SOMEWHERE ACTUALLY CONVENIENT LIKE THE TOP! That's not an issue when the Flow feature works, allowing you to move the cursor across two separate devices, but the reliability of the Flow is frustrating. The flow inexplicably stops working at random times for random durations. Sometimes it's due to dodgy internet, but my internet seemed totally fine today and flow refused to work until the workday ended, then it decided to resume flawless function. For such a useful feature to be hamstrung by bugginess is really disappointing, with insult to injury being the multi-device button being on the bottom.I wish I had gone with the cheaper triathlon model, which has the multi-device button on the top, since the Flow can't be relied on.

You won't be disappointed by this mouse.  It truly works on all surfaces, has solid button click, great features, and feels great in the hand.I love the scroll wheel that magnetically allows you to scroll line by line, or flick and zoom through a document or web page.I also love the multi computer functionality.  It allows selecting one of 3 different computers via a button on the bottom.  Where this is useful is when using it through bluetooth.  My wife and I have several laptops and this allows it to be paired with multiple laptops and it remembers each and connects to only the one with the associated setting which is changed by a button on the bottom.The rechargeable lithium battery lasts for weeks and the mouse can be used while charging via the USB-C cord.It's expensive but I'm so glad I spent a little extra to get such a solid mouse.

I do quite a bit of CAD work as an engineer and am constantly on multiple computers.  Mouse feels comfortable and works well.  I have the keyboard as well.  This is a pretty slick way of controlling 3 machines with just a single mouse and keyboard.  I definitely recommend using the setting to hold control to switch between computers.  I originally had it where if I touched the edge of the screen it would jump over to the other computer.  This started causing issues since it takes a second for the mouse to jump over to the other machine.  With the Control button, it won't go over unless I want it to.  The only down side is that if you have a VPN on one of the machines, it sometimes stops working.  You then have to use the keyboard ""1, 2 or 3"" buttons to switch which is not a big deal for being able to switch seamlessly between 3 machines.

I've had the MX Masters since they first came out maybe 10 years ago. The MX Master 3 is the latest version as of 2022. The thumb forward/back buttons aren't quite as nice as the older versions, but they're good enough. The scroll wheel is still excellent, with the clutch for high-speed scrolling. USB-C charging is a nice addition. Works fine on Mac, Linux and Windows. (On Mac you might want to install LinearMouse.) Solid, reliable, comfortable, fast and accurate. What more could you ask?

I wish I bought this mouse long ago!  It's great!It's a very quick press of a button (underneath), and I switch from one computer to another.  Very cool and useful if you multitask with multiple devices!One minor complaint that's really more of a ""wish list"" item for later models - The mouse comes with a wireless feature.  You plug in the USB receiver to the computer, and the mouse connects without the need for Bluetooth.  That's great, but what if I'm not using that piece?  (I may use it, but rarely.)  I don't want to lose that very tiny USB receiver.  Here is my suggestion:Put a small slot for the very small USB receiver.  (I've seen it on other wireless mice.)  That way the USB piece would always be with the mouse if and when needed.Still, this is the best mouse I've ever had.  Money well-spent indeed!

I have been using seriously old Logitech MX Revolution mice for years. I bought a half dozen of them a decade ago. Because frankly ever other mouse simply didn't have wheels and buttons to keep up. But my MX mice are getting long in the teeth and I needed a new mouse that could handle more than one computer at a time.Enter the magic MX Master! Wow, everything I had in the MX, PLUS the little button on the bottom that switches between three devices! OH YEA, I bought half a dozen of these, five still in the box. Because the MX Master is king for the next decade.If you want to do the same, keep your mouse batteries in the fridge and they will be fresh years from now when you want to use your new old mouse.

I bought the MX Vertical (see my review on this).  but returned it to get this MX Master 3. This one is great as it's your traditional mouse but with a lot more functionality. See Logitech website or video for all it's features.  I connect via Bluetooth and charge it with the USB cable it comes with. There is also the micro USB to connect with but I don't use it as I am limited to 2 USBs on my laptop. I connect both my Logitech ERGO K860 keyboard via Bluetooth too. I am a tax accountant so this mouse allows me to move through PDFs, tax software, Excel, online tax organizers, and Outlook perfectly. There is a functionality pre programmed to move from tabs within documents but am still trying to figure out how to move backward.  Seems it goes to the next page in PDF but won't go back to previous page. Anyway, I recommend this mouse even though it's really expensive. Think of it as a long term purchase when you depreciate it by $25 each year. Well worth it.

I REALLY wanted to love this mouse.  However, on a Mac, the scrolling on the MX Master 3S is jittery, even with ""Smooth Scrolling"" turned on.  I ended up returning the mouse because I could never get the scrolling as smooth as the Apple Magic Trackpad or Magic Mouse.  If you're used to smooth scrolling on a Mac, you'll be disappointed with the scrolling on this mouse.  In addition, I have large hands, and I found the Gesture button and back/forward buttons to be a bit awkward to use.  Finally, I wish there was an option for a USB-C receiver instead of the included USB-A one.

This product works as described and I'm happy I purchased it

Bottom line up, I ended up initiating return after about 2 hours of use/trial.CONS:1. Scroll Wheel: The biggest issue with this mouse is the scrolling, scrolling is VERY inconsistent.  When you are scrolling up and down with the scroll wheel, it does not move at a smooth or constant rate. If you are used to trackpad or magic mouse, you probably know what I mean.2. Gesture button: The location of this gesture button is not optimal.  I attached the pictures but naturally, your finger will rest much higher than where the gesture button is actually located and it's really hard to use the whole gestures.  My main productivity involves around all these gestures.  I'm currently running a dual monitor setup with multiple desktop spaces per screen, and having easy access to mission control and full desktop scrolling is crucial for me.  This unnatural placement of the gesture button makes these functions really hard.3.  ** EDIT: LOGITECH commented saying there is a way to setup with a single dongle. Please discard this** USB dongle:  This one is not a deal-breaker BUT... it's still a CON for me.  So, I purchased this mouse as a set with the MX Keys.  I initially thought since these two devices are in the same product line, I could just get away with using a single USB dongle.  But until I had both of the dongles plugged in, I was not able to use both devices.  So, having to use two dongles pretty much fills up all my port and I need to get an additional hub in order to compensate for lack of USB space.  If I were to use a magic mouse, magic trackpad, and full size magic keyboard, I wouldn't even need a single port because they all run on bluetooth.  Sacrificing one USB port is ok, two is just not optimal.After realizing all these flaws within an hour or so of use, I just had to initiate return because using the MX Keys and MX Master 3 will not increase any of my productivity.PROS:Since I did a fair amount of complaining, here are some plus.1. Software:  Logitech software is pretty amazing when it comes to customization.  You are able to inverse the trackwheel scrolling directions on mac without affecting the natural track scrolling directions of the trackpad or the OS settings itself.  This is actually a huge plus since there are other manufacture mice (razer) that do not let you do this and when you inverse the mouse directions on the macOS settings itself, you are inversing trackpad scrolling as well.  Logitech has an override for the trackwheel scrolling direction, and it's really awesome.  Also, you can map A LOT of different gestures/functions to additional buttons on the mouse, and have options to map buttons differently according to the app you are using.2. Mouse Track:  Tracking on the mouse is really awesome, no signs of an intermittent drop in connections, and feels almost like using a wired mouse.

I liked being able to program the buttons specifically for different programs, but the software is way too glitchy.  And I'm always running Logitech and updating it whenever anything is available.I have the thumb scroll wheel (on the side) set to scroll in Excel, then randomly it will invert directions.  Or it won't work at all.  Or suddenly it started changing what was on my screen.  And once it just started changing the computer volume up and down.  All while I was still in Excel.  I have to click to another file, or exit my file and reopen, or plug in the mouse, or unplug it all to try to get it to work again.  And this is the same on both of this same mouse that I purchased.I also have issues with the normal vertical scroll wheel where the wheel loves to scroll down (sometimes I move my finger a little and it decides to just keep going for an extra 5 seconds even when I try to stop it or scroll up.  In Excel I can scroll down a thousand rows in a few seconds, but I feel like it takes 20 minutes to scroll back up using the wheel.  In some programs it will suddenly zoom in/out 100x because of the scroll.So if you can deal with it being glitchy, when it works it's a pretty good mouse with some cool functions.

I had the original MX100 mouse, which was also somewhat costly.However, it performed like nothing else.I was willing to pay the exorbitant price for this one, as the others are no longer available.After three fraught days of using it, I decided to order the internal battery for my old one, which included taking it apart (not easy).It was worth sending this one back.

Okay, first, I have big hands. So while this is probably perfect for someone with normal hands, I find it to be just a little on the small/light side for my tastes - My Logitech PerformanceMX mouse is a little bigger/heavier. With that said, the MX3 is currently my go-to mouse for long days, for two reasons: it partners well with my MX Keys keyboard and the tiny USB-A Unify dongles allow this mouse (and the keyboard) to easily be shared across the computers on my desk with a button press on the bottom of the mouse and on the keyboard, eliminating the need for multiple keyboards.Unify also allows the mouse/keyboard to automatically ""flow"" from one screen to another, if the computers are on the same network (sorry, if one of the computers is running a VPN, this will probably NOT work).Overall, very happy with this mouse.

The features are awesome, had some trouble with the flow feature at first not working on the software but was able to get it working after restarting both computers. Everything works great now!

The mouse seems nice. However it is not fully compatible with the most recent version of Mac OS 13 Ventura.

The MX Master 3 is GREAT. Right out the box you could see the texture and know it is a high-quality mouse. Ergonomic, it is incredible, does not feel like any other mouse. Precise tracking on any surface and ultrafast scrolling, this mouse will Optimize your workflow, whether your working with Windows Office or with Adobe Creative Cloud or other editing software. your able to connect to three devices. The LogiOptions app allows you to custom set the buttons & scrolls. It is Compatible with Mac and Windows. Battery life is incredible, Charges via USB-C. I highly recommend to pair with the ""Logitech Craft Advanced Wireless Keyboard"". I enjoy this combo so much i bought the same mouse & Keyboard for my desk at work.

I have the previous model on my home computer, so naturally I needed to buy one for the office.  I do like this more then the old model because the wheel is better, the thumb buttons are easier to hit.  The ""undo redo"" buttons are great in word, but the thumb down will pull up all your windows (WINDOWS + TAB).  Really nice to have the more universal USB-C charging port.  I love how fast the mouse curser is, but somehow you still have the control you want.I'm more of a console gaming person, so I asked my snobby PC gaming buddy what he thinks; naturally he says the mouse isn't great for gaming.  Well I work in windows and spreadsheets all day and I think its fantastic.  Plus you have to factor in that he spends all his time watching twitch and not actually playing, so... well you know.
",5
"
Overall a good/promising device; however, neither Options nor Options+ allowed me to change the side scroll-wheel to do vertical scrolling instead of horizontal. I wanted to do this since the device felt bulky, so I customized the middle button to act as if I'm pressing the scroll-wheel button, but then I wanted to fully abandon using the vertical scroll-wheel and the side one instead and I couldn't.Also have experienced some connectivity issues with Bluetooth. The mouse pointer would disappear sometimes. But connecting through the unifying receiver seems to solving the issue. Overall I have ended up buying 3 different Logitech mice over the course of past month or so, which is this one, the MX Anywhere and Lift and this one is the best.

Pretty good mouse. I have been with the series since Performance Mouse MX. This mouse has a great quality feel - sturdy yet soft to the touch.Tracking is exceptional on all surfaces whether bumpy or clear. You don’t need a mouse pad. I barely need to charge it — maybe once a month.The only complaint that I have is the scroll wheel is has textured metal ridges that will probably hurt your finger. Luckily my finger has gotten used to it after a week or so but we should have to callous  over for a product.Every thing else is great, no regrets.

Using with an iMac - super comfortable unlike the original mouse. Scroll wheels work fine, although (as expected) can't program the additional buttons.

This mouse is a dream come true--not only can I switch between up to three computers with a button push, but it is incredibly comfortable and there are so many handy functions.  I took away a star, however, because the setup instructions are completely useless.  Typical of Logitech.  There is software called Logitech Options that you must use to configure this and the MX keyboard.  In addition, when you try to set this device up with another computer, there is exactly ZERO information on how to do that.  I finally got it done by trial and error, but Logitech needs to hire someone who can write complete documentation and then include it in the package!  However, once set up, this is a great mouse!

On both my Mac and PC the mouse will randomly zoom in when scrolling.  Which is expected behavior if you're holding the command key on Mac.  But I'm not pressing any keys.  It happens a few times a day.  So not enough to warrant returning or getting a different mouse but still pretty annoying.  Searching around I see a few others have had this issue but no fixes.

I had my MX Master 2S for 6 years, using it almost every day. It died. I got the MX Master 3, and things that should have improved are: USB-C charging, improved feedback of the thumb switch. But they kept the great stuff the same. A reliable product that is even better the next time you have to buy it.

I had an MX Master for years and it finally gave it up.  I decided to go with the MX Master 3 Advanced and am very happy.  It feels great in the hand and works great.  I don't game much so can't speak for that function.

I've been a Logitech M705 mouse user for the last several years. I upgraded to this Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse based on a recommendation from a reputable computer company (System 76). The mouse fits my hand comfortably, is very smooth to use, and provides the optimal tactile response as far as buttons and scrolling. I use this mouse with a gel wrist pad and leather mouse pad.I also upgraded my keyboard from a Logitech K710 to an MX Keys Advanced Wireless Keyboard (and Logitech wrist pad for thin keyboards), and am also pleasantly surprised with the keyboard's solid metal construction, smooth and well-defined key response, and smart back lighting. Both the keyboard and mouse use a USB-C connected re-chargeable battery; haven't had them long enough to determine time between recharges.Both items were purchased as separate orders from Amazon direct (Amazon.com Services LLC), and both arrived on-time and in perfect condition.

I've had and used this mouse for almost a year now for everything outside of gaming, and I'm pretty sure I've needed to charge it maybe 3 times? That alone is pretty incredible, but the scroll wheel is so satisfying that switching to any other mouse is so jarring. The rubberized finish is very comfortable, and definitely feels premium in a way that's hard to describe. This is not a gaming mouse by any means, nor was it intended to serve that function. It's too heavy for FPS titles, and the software is not geared towards gamers in any way. I intend on updating this review in a year or two if the battery life drastically decreases, but I consider this to be the best daily driver mouse for everyone that isn't primarily looking for something gaming-oriented. $100 is quite pricey, but if it lasts, then it's well worth the money.

The white looks so good and feel of the mouse is awesome. I have recently tested it on FPS games , all I can say is WOW. I've recently converted to wireless and this feels so good and free. Its worth the purchase. MASTER 3S is awesome.

I'm a programmer and casual gamer.  I tried this an upgrade over my Razer Deathadder Elite for ergonomics.  Never have I so instantly regretted a purchase.  I'm glad that plenty of people find this mouse comfortable, and maybe you will too.  But for me, after just a short while using it, my hand and arm began to ache.  I gave it two days, but it just wasn't for me.  Comparing it to my old mouse, I realize that the slope where the palm is is much steeper than on typical mice, which meant my hand was kind of hovering over the back unless I pushed my hand way forward on the mouse, was was also uncomfortable. I wondered if I was doing something wrong but I found other users online with similar complaints.  I ended up returning it and getting a Logitech G703 instead, which had a similar form factor to my old mouse and was much more comfortable.  So, just a heads up, this design doesn't work for everyone.

I have a MacOS system and PC that runs Linux and Windows. This was the mouse that ran with Linux. The PC now sits in the living room as a VR system, so I bought a second mouse.

I use this with a Macbook Pro along with a Logitech MX Keys wireless keyboard.  What a fantastic combo!  Seamlessly moves between my Mac and PC via the Logitech Options software (LogiFlow).  I also love that you can charge both the mouse and keyboard via USB C.  I don't use the mouse for gaming, but for a lot of Zoom meetings and document, spreadsheet, and presentation work.  The extra scrool wheel and buttons (that can be customized per application) are truly game-changer.  Highly recommended.

I have worked with this mouse for well over a year.  I simply cannot get the side scroll wheel to work.  The size of the mouse is fine (I have large hands), it moves well on a mouse pad, all control buttons, functions, EXCEPT the side scroll wheel work fine.  I am not a computer beginner, but have just given up on getting the side scroll to work.  Very dissapointed, I bought it especially for the side scroll, obviously did not get what I paid for.

I had the original MX master and thoroughly wore that out, somehow ended up with a hole that kept growing near where the thumb sits so figured it was time for an upgrade.This one is just as good, nice metal scroll wheels feel more high end.  Ergonomics are perfect.I've been spoiled using logitechs for the past 20 years or so exclusively and had to use a crappy work mouse recently and that just helped me confirm why I need to stick with the logitechs ,they're the best.This one has a nice matte finish on it, just a subtle texture.It glides really easy.  Thumbs up all around.I use it for precise mouse work, illustrator, photoshop stuff and it has just the right weight to move easily, but not too flimsy where you throw it around too much like the cheapo mice.

Amazing mouse for productivity. The way it navigate both vertically and horizontally on coffee projects and web pages is amazing and using the thumb button for applications navigation is great as well. I also use it for gaming and the buttons and ergonomics help extremely well.

I really really wanted to love this mouse. I'd read so many positive reviews on it. It did have some negative reviews on the scroll wheel. It is a known issue, there a plenty of forums on it but, I wanted to give it a shot. Sadly as much as I loved all the convenient features on it like the software, the customization with the function buttons, and the ergonomics of it. In the end the scroll wheel was what did it for me. I used for two days and just couldn't stand it. Especially using it for work were I had to scroll though pages of information. I noticed a drastic difference on how the scroll wheel works for my Dell work computer VS my Mac. It works better on the Mac but, still has some issues.  I tried adjusting the settings in the Logitech software app but nothing was working for me. In theory the MagSpeed feature is great, but this is what hinders me from giving this a 5 star review. Not to mention the premium price tag on it, you'd think Logitech would have everything figured out perfectly on it. Which is why I give this a 3 star review. If you work on older software for hours at a time this mouse might not be for you.

If you use many different types of apps; coding, graphics, documents, spreads, etc, and find yourself needing customized buttons and scroll speeds for different workflows, this is your mouse.  High quality, excellent ergonimics and built-in rechargeable batteries make this a winner for me. fast USB-C charging as well. So pleased I purchased a second one to use with my work laptop the next day. Reccomend.

I’ve had so many issues with this mouse it’s insane.  I essentially need to keep it plugged in for it to work like it’s supposed to and sometimes that still doesn’t work!  You can move the mouse, regardless of surface as I’ve tried so many, and the cursor doesn’t move.  Then all of a sudden it jets off somewhere to the side of the screen and it takes a minute or so to try and get it back to where it needs to be.

Bluetooth and dongle did not stop this mouse from stuttering or lagging. It happened frequently and it's frustrating because it interrupts my flow. It happens also if you leave the mouse alone like it's waking up. Wouldn't be a problem if it stopped there but it persisted frequently. It had all the updates, I did not have other bluetooth devices nearby. I even tried the dongle and that still lagged and it was plugged into the port on top of my PC so I don't know where the interference comes from. Resorted to using my cheap, battery powered, dongle plug in mouse that has no problems. I just bought a new computer so there must be a software issue that I'm not aware of.Despite all of that, I lOVED the features on this mouse and the customizability of the buttons. Shame it was buggy.

Summary: Mouse is twitchy, mis-clicks and has the worst software I've usedIt regularly causes me to click-drag-copy files in Windows and lowering it's sensitivity means I have to swipe too much, to get the mouse across my two screens.  No, I'm not new to using mice and I own a 10k dpi gaming mouse that I have no problems with.  And before you suggest I adjust the dpi, I should point out that ""Options"", the Logitech software for Windows (which has almost no options, ironically) doesn't allow the user to change the dpi or mouse polling rate.  There's only a sensitivity setting, like Windows 10 already has.But that's just a minor complaint.  The main problems are the mouse-wheel, which is touted as an improvement over normal wheels, but feels more like a really bad automatic transmission; always scrolling WAY to far, or not far enough.  And since they replaced the normal mechanism, you can't turn it off, but without the feature enabled, the wheel response is terribly sluggish.The biggest trigger for me, however, has to be the button design for the two main buttons.  The design flows over the front of the mouse, so that merely bumping into your coffee cup, or your keyboard will cause it to click the mouse!  We all have times in our computer use, where doing this would be disastrous.  If you have Windows 10 set to place your cursor above the ""OK"" button, whenever dialog windows come up, it's even more dangerous.I've been using a mouse with my computers since I was 8 years old; so 35 years.  Never have I had so many issues.  I never had a problem with a mouse being too sensitive or twitchy.  My G502 works great, but I need a wireless mouse.And if you're thinking of buying this mouse for the ability to use it on multiple desktops, I hope you don't use Linux, or you're in for a let-down.  I was hoping to use it with my Windows machine and one running Linux Mint Cinnamon 20, but Logitech doesn't develop for the Linux platform.I doubt anyone is going to see this review, without a lot of digging, but for those who do find it, check all the 5-star reviews, and 9 times, out of 10, you'll find that they are all affiliates for the product.  These people are literally just salesmen.  Don't trust a thing they say.  They get 10% or more from every sale.  Amazon allows this.  They might as well just let the companies make up completely fictional people and have sales people write the reviews.

"
I liked the mouse, it is very handy when you're working on multiple devices.My main complaint is the scroll wheel, it broke in less than a month. It kind of works, but it no longer 'provides feedback' while scrolling, it does not fixes its position. It now also has a lag, so the scrolling stops later than I actually stop using the wheel.
",3
"
I don't get it, Logitech. You've had so long to perfect your hardware.Pros:- The hand position and feel of the mouse in hand is perfect.- Has some extra features (thought most won't need).Cons:- Mouse tracking is not great. I can tell the polling rate is low, the cursor doesn't move smoothly compared to other mice.- The scroll wheel is hot garbage. It will randomly scroll a line in the wrong direction or not at all.Overall, I have to say skip it. The quality of the scroll wheel is the deciding factor here. I expected better from Logitech, especially at this price point. I returned it and got a Razer Basilisk Ultimate instead. Even though it lacks a few of the productivity features, I don't really need those, and it works better.

I use this with my newly acquired Apple Mac mini w/ M1 chip works very nicely with it and was immediately sensed and useable from the first boot up. Some mice from other brands i have used left much to be desired when using the scroll feature but this one is solid and doesn’t hang up slip or refuse to move or hesitate when using the scroll wheel like some other brands have done when you move whether a small movement or large rotation it is perfectly synced with the desired outcome. It does exactly what you want it to do it when you want it to with no lag at all, very nice.

Been huge fan of the MX Master series for some time now and the 3 is an excellent upgrade to the 2S.  I use my mouse daily for engineering; mostly spreadsheets and BIM/CAD like work across 3x 32"" 4k monitors.  I'm brutal on my mice and keyboards.  Best changes are:- usb c finally- back and forward button are closer and easier to reach with the thumb; much better for mapping the middle button to- feels great; smooth with weight but not burdensome to move around.  Glides across the mouse pad- sized well for folks with fairly big hands- Can't notice any lag, but I don't use it for gamingMy biggest gripe with its predecessors has been durability.  The feet and battery usually wear out after a couple of years.  The feet can be replaced.  Finding a replacement battery with the correct voltage [in the U.S.] is a whole other story.  Will report back if the same happens with this one.
",5

This mouse has fantastic ergonomics and I love the weight.  I rally like the side scroll wheel and the forward/back buttons are placed pretty well.  I have noticed that the receiver needs to be fairly close or the response starts to lag.  This could potentially be an issue in competitive gaming, but not an issue for productivity really.  Not an issue at all if you are able to have the mouse about 2-feet or less from the receiver.I really like that this can be paired with more than one receiver and is the reason I purchased this mouse.  That feature works perfectly.  The flow technology works reasonably well.  There is slight lag when moving between computers, but I would not expect it to work the same as with two monitors on a single computer.

This is a superior upgrade over several mice I've owned over the years. The control and feel are perfect. For someone who'd have to scroll through long logs and code bases and uses a lot of varied interfaces, this is a must need. Paired with the keyboard from the same brand, this ecosystem opens up a very complete experience of improved typing and mouse interaction. I may not suggest this mouse for serious gaming as I'm worried that this may ruin the buttons which to me feel like too precious and not too robust for a gaming intensity.One feature I wish to see is the desktop selection button to be on the accessible surface of the device. The button is right now, underneath the mouse which requires me to constantly lift the mouse. I'd like to see if the mouse, when paired with same family keyboard could follow the keyboard's choice of desktop instead of manually switching keyboard and mouse separately.

So I have the MX Master 2 for a couple years used daily for work.  Worked great until I tapped it and it went INSANE doing all kinds of random stuff.  So I picked up this one.  Like the MX 2 works great, the free spinning scroll wheel is a lifesaver when scrolling through long lists of stuff.  Had it since July 29th and it's been on it's first charge, which is quite good since it's used nearly constantly 7 hours a day 5 days a week.  The software works better on this one as well.  Overall I would recommend to anyone looking for a solid wireless mouse.

We've all had plenty of mouse(s).  Doesn't sound right to say ""mice"" since this isn't really a living thing.  Regardless, it's the best I've ever owned.  I scroll wheel is especially of high quality.  It's a nice, hard metal/plastic component that has a ""click"" feel (without the click sound) when you scroll.  If you speed up your scroll to much faster it actually falls into a freefall mode where the click goes away and it feels incredibly smooth and has a bit of inertia.  What I mean is that it doesn't stop scrolling, it continues on its own, until you stop it with your finger.  As a software developer I find myself inside files with thousands of lines of code and this has served as an excellent way to rapidly navigate up/down to where I want to get.I recommend this mouse with zero hesitation.

Overall seems good.Scroll wheel is silent, which is great. But its scroll wheel is also quirky, and not always in a good way.If you spin its scroll wheel fast, it spins for an extremely long time (easily 10 full seconds). So you can scroll far with very little effort. But it also means that you constantly have to stop the wheel from spinning to avoid accidentally scrolling long after you originally meant to scroll. For example, dozens of times per day I found myself accidentally scrolled to the bottom of a page because I switched tabs after scrolling to the bottom of an earlier page. I'm sure I would have learned to use it better over time, but I gave it at least a week and it kept bothering me very frequently.Additionally, I often found the scroll wheel to behave poorly at short distances, which really annoyed me. In certain scenarios (I couldn't fully figure out when) it sort of just failed to scroll as far as it should. I think it was probably related to the automatic scroll mode switching. For example, maybe if you scroll a short distance too fast it mistakenly goes into its long-distance mode, which scrolls a shorter distance per wheel rotation. In any case, it was really annoying.

While my hands aren't huge, they are larger than average (I am 6'2''). Finding a comfortable mouse I don't have to claw can be difficult. That is why I absolutely loved the MX 1 and 2, so when I heard the 3 came out I jumped at the opportunity to grab the latest and greatest.... Bad decision.Cons:- Where the MX 1 and 2 were very comfortable, the MX 3 is much smaller and oddly shaped. To hold it the way it is intended your hand is at a 45 degree angle meaning your wrist cannot rest comfortably. Hello, Carpal Tunnel.- Being a smaller mouse along with the awkward angle means my pinky and ring finger have no where to rest. My fingers literally drag against my desk while using it.- The bottom side button is more narrow and deeper than previous models. I literally can't press it with the side of my thumb (as intended). I have to lift my hand up and use the tip of my thumb to activate it... Who tested this?- Last but not least, the scroll wheel is defective. It to randomly skips/becomes unresponsive when scrolling. I found that others describe the same issue on various forums. I can only assume this means it is a design flaw and not an isolated case. This is a shame because otherwise I like the smooth feel of the new scroll wheel.- Overall, the mouse feels to be inferior quality to its predecessors.Pros:- The two side buttons above your thumb are actually easy to press. Having large hands those two buttons were unusable on the MX 1 and 2.- Is USB C.... but charger chord that comes along with it is USB -> USB C... So depending on your situation it might be useless to you.Overall, very disappointed.P.S. I gave only 1 stars for gaming because it is way too heavy to be a competitive gaming mouse IMO... To be fair, it just isn't designed to be a gaming mouse which is fine. I bought it for work. I have another mouse for that.

Overall fantastic mouse. Be sure to plug the receiver into a USB-2 slot, rather than USB 3.0+ as doing so causes minor response issues.

My job is mostly done by Mouse versus keyboard I use it all day long click click click click it's comfortable my hand doesn't hurt my wrist doesn't hurt worth the money kind of cool feature you can use it on two devices with a switch of the bottom button so pretty cool

I've tried multiple cleaning methods shared by community members on Reddit as well as in these comments. While I absolutely the MX Master line, I noticed distinct yellowing along the ridges on each side of the moues (thumb and pinky) which cannot be removed. If you're considering this device, get darker color options.

Excellent ergonomics plus various buttons to support different work flows. The buttons can be customised with the Logi application. My favourite is the infinite scroll wheel which I use often to scroll through long files.

The scroll is very inconsistent

This mouse looks nice and feels nicer. Once you get to feel its wheel, you won't ever want to go back to other mice. The battery lasts a long time: I recharge it once every month and a half or so, and I use this every day for work and gaming. There isn't any noticeable latency with the computer as well. It feels as responsive as a wired mouse.This is pretty expensive, but it's worth it. I've had it for over a year and haven't had a single issue with it. If it breaks down, I'll for sure buy the same model as a replacement. I even got one for my wife!

Comfortable for someone with large hands and side scroll works flawless for wide format spreadsheet definitely worth the price

This is my third model in this series, they just keep getting better. I especially like the USBC and the quieter mouse buttons.

I think the product is great, but Logitech does a horrible job implementing it. ~50% of the time I turn mac my back on I can expect my MX Master 3 and Craft keyboard to be totally unresponsive. They just simply won't connect to my mac anymore. Of course, Logitech support has no clue what's going on, so the only suggestion is to uninstall the logi options, restart my machine, reinstall the software, re-pair, and configure my settings all over again. So at least once a week I have to do this whole song and dance and it's infuriating.I finally said screw it and bought an Apple Magic Keyboard and Trackpad. It's just not worth the headache anymore. Sorry Logitech, you had a good product, but you dropped the ball, over and over and over and over again.

My son love that, everyday he find another function that it can preform.

Battery life is excellent.  Usually lasts over a month of everyday use.  I work from home and also do projects on my computer after work, so this gets hours of use everyday.  Shape is good.  Like the forward and back buttons and horizontal scroll wheel.  Hoping for many years of use.

With this mouse you can use any surface. The other thing is you can program the mouse buttons as needed. You can also connect to 3 different devices. I have multiple versions of this mouse and I have been very happy with its performance.

This mouse is amazing. The customizable features that logitech put into this is very helpful for Excel and Blue Beam. I gave only 3 stars because I have not had it over 2 months and it has begun drifting. It scrolls down very slowly but it is irritating when I am reviewing documents. For the price I did not expect to have any issues. I hope that no one else encounters this problem. Mine may just be defective.

As promised, this Mouse has a mastery of control over its functions like nothing i've used before. I highly recommend it to others, as it will serve you well in most if not all situations.

I've tried dozens of different mice and this is my favorite.

Perfect mouse for office, the plastic, the quality, the feel is just superb. But I can’t give it the perfect review because of the sheer fact I bought it specifically to be used with Mac / Windows 10. Logitech Flow software tends to slowly respond to mouse over one system screen to another, sometimes the driver needs to be restarted to make the advertised combination of MX Keys keyboard to work with MX Master. So, this mouse work great for the simple task yet it fails to deliver the promoted ease of use for multiple systems.
",4
"
It's a great mouse. But DO NOT buy it if you plan to use it while on VPN. Flow won't work properly. Options+ (the app for customization) can't load half of the time. You get logged off from platforms (supported under VPN only) every few minutes. I simply can't get my job done with this mouse.Besides I'm a MacBook Pro user. There's a way to change the scroll direction, but that'll mess up your touch pad scroll direction at the same time. Unless you rarely use touch pad, otherwise not handy for MacBook users.

This seems to be a known issue with this mouse - the scroll wheel feels flimsy has a strange issue where it clicks/vibrates again after stopping initially. Otherwise, other features like ergonomic design, battery life, connectivity, customization, and silent clicks are great.

Well constructed and feels good in the hand. I'm pleased with the side buttons, but the scroll wheel will, annoyingly, switch to free rolling if you scroll fast enough, even in ratcheted mode.Purchased this mouse primarily because of its advertised ability to switch seamlessly between multiple connected devices. This is an absolute lie. The button to switch between devices is on the bottom of the mouse, meaning in order to switch between connected devices, you have to stop what you're doing and flip the thing over to access the button. I'm baffled that this design made it past the earliest stages of product development.
",4
"
Already had the MX keys which was great to switch between my 3 devices flawlessly. I prefer a vertical mouse, but wanted to have the same option switching between devices with my mouse. So far not disappointed. Features are great and comfort is no issue so far. Using it for business mainly so no gaming experience to share. But lasts a good amount of time on a charge which makes this a winner.

The mouse is good but my only issue is that it does not connect via Bluetooth. I don't know why, maybe because my laptop is a MacBook Pro mid-2015? it could be.

Seemed like a great mouse in the pictures description. I game lightly and use the mouse for productivity, thus I wanted wireless and long battery life. Everything seems great on it and the scroll wheel was awesome! Unfortunately I like to be able to control my mouse with my fingertips for high accuracy tasks and the ergonomics made that really hard with the fact that the click buttons were not attached to the complete plastic housing (i tend to click far back.) Works ok with my upright work, but not my reclined which is more than 3/4 of my time. great mouse, just not for me. Also Please make the forward back buttons larger! My G700 will still keep on kicking with its horrible battery life.

The scroll wheel is awesome. The fit and finish is awesome though it should have a model slippery rubber coating when I can get around that problem. The buttons are decent enough. The scroll wheel is awesome. But......Damn it damn it damn it. How many times is it going to take for you to get the damned forward and back buttons right!Version one sucked. Version 2 sucked. Version 3 walad admittedly slightly improved, STILL STUCK!They are too small , too stiff, and meld in to everything around them.They need to be made much larger and they need to be place much lower.Oh well. Maybe version 4 will get them right...TWO stars off for little or no useability testing with REAL customers instead of devs and managers.Damn it.

This was a wonderful mouse when it still worked.When you pick it up for the first time, you can really feel the eloquence of the MX Master 3. Using it as a productivity tool is a dream and you can easily tell how much effort Logitech put into the R&D of this mouse. So it’s really unfortunate that I have to write this and discourage others from buying it.Like some commenters have already expressed, there’s a defect with the magspeed scroll wheel that Logitech seemingly does not want to address. After using it for a little under a year, the scroll wheel started to get a bit loose and make an acute grating noise with each flick. This was only noticeable in ‘ratchet mode,’ but unfortunately that’s the only mode I use the mouse on. I reached out to Logitech customer service hoping to get a replacement since it was under their 1 year warranty.After talking with a rep and even sending them a video of the issue, they wrote back and said that it was not enough evidence provided to move forward with my claim. This was really surprising as I did not expect to get push back from a company as large as Logitech when there’s video evidence of the issue of their product.I bought this very early in its release and unfortunately I did not listen to the warnings other users gave. This is a great mouse, but it’s just not durable... for $100, I would have hoped that it would last me longer than a year. If you’re in the market for a mouse, I would stay away from the MX Master 3, or maybe even Logitech as a company...
",2
"
Since its predecessor (the Performance MX) was first introduced in 2010, the MX Master is the only mouse I buy. I use a mouse intensively for 8-10 hours a day at work and at least 2-3 hours a day at home almost daily, and I've bought over a dozen of these for my own use over the past decade. The mouse is well made, precise, and the free-spinning wheel is invaluable for some applications (the reason I bought it originally). The battery lasts me about a week of heavy use between charges, and it recharges fully from empty in a couple of hours. Downsides for some might be size (if you have small hands), weight (it's medium, not light), free-spinning scroll takes a little getting used to (but you don't have to use the feature), price (if you are budget conscious). Otherwise I would highly recommend the mouse to anyone who depends on a mouse to get their work done.

This is a good mouse, however I noticed quite a bit of lagging when using it with macbook pro M1. If you are mac user, please do not purchase this as there are some compatibility issues with it.

You get what you pay for.  Ergonomically, the best mouse!  Had carpel tunnel from using the Apple mouse for years and after purchasing several different ones, I finally found one that eases the stress on my wrist/arm/shoulder.  Very intuitive with super fast scrolling.  Highly recommended.

I have found this to be a very comfortable mouse, the shape and hand angle have helped with my hand pain from spending too much time on the computer.  It is heavy compared to most mice, and I like that.

I have a setup of an iMac, Macbook Air and HP laptop (from work). So being able to control these 3 devices with 1 keyboard-mouse setup makes my life so much easier. 100% recommended.

I have been using this mouse for two months now. I have been using different low to mid tier mouses in the past. I finally jumped on this MX train and it has been a good decision.Pros-Let's talk about the scroll wheel first. The ""infinity"" magspeed scroll on this mouse is AMAZING. I could scroll through pages of code smoothly in any code editor. However, there was a bit of a lag when browsing through web pages. I believe this might be because of my i5 processor as other applications handled it well.-The ergonomics on this mouse are just brilliant. The thumb buttons are exactly where they need to be and are fully customizable.Cons-The only one I can think of is build quality. I have paid a premium for this product. I wish Logitech would come up with better quality construction materials.

I programmed the buttons to be copy, paste, and enter and my life has changed for the better! Monotonous excel tasks are of the past!

I have terrible carpal tunnel and I use an Imak glove to offset nerve pain.I have tried various ""ergonomic"" mice that are vertical, and it's just too much of a change to get used to that I eventually just go back to the classic mouse.This mouse has nailed it. It has a slight tilt to it which offsets your hand just enough to relieve the pressure. The thumb rest is perfect and allows you to comfortably maneuver the mouse.Clicks are very tactile and nice and has a nice premium feel to it.Well done Logitech! Finally, a mouse I can use comfortably!!!

Sure when you unbox it and let that scroll wheel spin it feels amazing. Until it doesn't. Once you use the wheel on a web page you will instantly realize it doesn't work like it should. It takes a moment to recognize input. It will over scroll an pass where you intend for it to stop. Some times it starts going up randomly when you are scrolling down. This wheel breaks a probably pretty decent mouse. I honestly cannot fathom why people are praising this wheel. Its completely frustrating to use. The metal wheel itself feels amazing I just wish it worked like a scroll wheel. It seems like they are trying to market a flaw as a feature.This mouse sucks. Will be returning after less than a hour of use.Do better Logitech. I used to really value you mouse quality.

By far the best mouse I have ever used.  Most comfortable, features everything I desire in a mouse.  It also stays charged very long with the cable removed.  If you can afford this mouse you should give it a try.  I'm glad I did.
",5
"
Product description says full charge lasts up-to 70 days, but in my experience it was more like 25-30 days. It's not a big deal for me personally (as it charges to full in like an hour or two and is still fully usable while wired) and is pretty much the only ""complain"" I have (and even then, only b/c it doesn't match the product description). It's very ergonomic / comfortable to use. I use it with Linux and it works very well (using logiops and/or solaar tools you can configure sensitivity, scroll wheel resolution and all the extra buttons as needed + monitor battery status, etc).

Very nicely built office mouse, had to return it because I have large hands and it causes severe strains after using it for a while.

"
I have loved the mouse, until now a little over a year later and it will no longer hold a charge for more than a day without having to be recharged where prior it had several months with the same usage. When I contacted Logitech about the issue with the mouse, they said they won't do anything about it. So keep that in mind. It's only good for about a year before it has to stay plugged in to be usable.

Ordered this to have the same mouse at home as I have at my office. Used for CAD work so the accuracy is a major factor plus the comfort for all day use. Plus the reliability of Logitech mice, as my previous performance MX has lasted for over 10 years. Only replaced it to be proactive!
",5

I bought this with the MX Keys. We have a Mac mini and a perfectly stable ASUS Prime Deluxe II PC build for composing music. The keyboard switches between both computers great, feels good and the modifier keys are cool. The mouse is not. Through Bluetooth, the mouse is not nearly as responsive as through the wireless receiver. Secondly on the PC, the software routinely geeks out and changes DPI/navigation resolution and hangs - with the receiver 18” away line of sight. I believe this is because unlike other wireless Logitech mouses I have, this one does not save the settings internally, and must work through the software for everything in real-time. This makes sense if you are switching computer platforms on the fly, but it often gives you very poor performance when you least expect it and is not dependable. My wife is content using it to surf the web on a Mac. Otherwise it’s a big waste of money on performance for people doing media-based film/music production. You’ll run into random lag and navigation problems while your only using 10% cpu. It requires a restart to reset the software and before you run into this without expecting it - it does NOT work wired. It only charges wired. SmhNeat idea, poorly executed.

This MX Master 3 mouse is amazing.  Well worth the extra money since I am using it +8 hours per day, every day.  Fits my medium large hand very nicely.  This is a replacement for a 10 year old Performance MX.  The roller ball is amazingly smooth and fun to use.  I access many large files and very nice to be able to hit the roller ball and see it fly through the pages as opposed to clicking through pages.  The sensing is very accurate for use in Revit and AutoCAD and does not require the use of a mouse pad.  The unifying dongle works great with an older Logitech ergonomic keyboard connected to a switch controlling two computers.

This mouse makes scrolling up, down, and sideways easier than any mouse I've used in the past. It fits in your hand really well and there is no lagging in scrolling, which I've experienced on my Mac using other mice.

I use this mouse on my WFH setup, and it replaced my basic Logitech mouse.  I'm a developer so I use my mouse and keyboard a lot, and I've been working a lot.  A few months ago I began to experience wrist discomfort which I was trying to address by changing mice.  This mouse seems to have helped eliminate my wrist discomfort now that my hand sits more naturally.  I also like the way the product material feels in my hand.  It just feels good.

I bought the Logitech MX Master. A while later, my father bought the MX Master 2S. I was jealous. Now I have the MX Master 3 and he is the jealous one. We were able to test out the 3. The first generation and second are very similar. Battery life lasts a very long time on all of them. The main difference that I noticed was the fact that you can move through 2 computers and bring over the clipboard. Amazing feature. I have not tried it on mine yet, however, my father uses it on his all the time. A huge difference between the 3 and the 2 is the actual layout is a bit different. It has a way better ergonomic layout. Feels so much better. Would definitely recommend. Very comfortable to use even after extended time periods
",5
"
It is a nice, smooth mouse with great features, but I have to change from the ergo grip to get the buttons right. Speaking of features, I really like the option to use the same mouse on multiple computers. However, I am unable to get this to work with the software provided?! Very Frustrating.

"
I read all the reviews and was really excited about getting this mouse, but ended up returning it after trying it out for 4 days.  I just couldn't get used to the size and way it felt in my hand.  My wrist also started hurting by day 3 after normal usage, which would only happen after VERY extended work sessions with my previous mouse.  I also hated the highly touted mouse wheel sensitive shift, or whatever it was they call it...Whenever I tried using the wheel, it just felt inaccurate and really laggy.  I played around with the settings quite a bit as well, trying pretty much every combination to make it work.  I REALLY wanted to like this mouse!  But after 4 days, I'm officially giving up on it.  I know it can take a few days to get used to a new mouse, but after switching back to my old one for a quick minute, I just don't see the point of suffering any longer.I don't doubt this is a perfectly good mouse for some people.  I'm sure some people absolutely love it.  It just wasn't for me...

If this mouse had a different wheel thing, it would be 5*, but the metal piece hurts my index finger so bad!  I wish it was rounded and a much softer material!

I received this mouse on June 15th and charged it overnight.  Today is October 10th and  just got the first notice that the battery level was low!!  That's FOUR MONTHS without charging the battery.  I am amazed with the battery life.This is my third Logitech mouse and I love them.  The scroll button works great.  Fits my hand very good.  Good options that are customizable.  If you want a good mouse, buy this one!  Nuff said!

I've been using a performance MX mouse at work and home for 5-6 years now.I recently upgraded to this mouse...Cons: The clicks on this mouse are louder than I expected. The scroll wheel will auto ""infinity scroll"" if you scroll too quickly. The power button (on the bottom) is no longer located in a position that allows for one hand support.Pros:It's super light! Love the usbc. Gray looks better than black. The additional scroll wheel on the thumb is appreciated, way better than a left right rocker on the MMB. The improved multitask thumbbutton is also appreciated, looks less flimsy.Unsure:The forward & back buttons may be a bit too small, but I'm at only 15 hours of use on the mouse.Overall great mouse, complaints are tiny and overshadowed by the rest of my experience with the mouse

Love this mouse. I've have a Logitech wireless mouse that I have used for about 8 years now which I love and use whenever I am working at the office. I wanted to get another mouse for when I work from home though so I don't have to pack up my entire desk every other day and without question grabbed another Logitech. It's incredibly well made, even more so than the one I've used for 8 years now, and fits perfectly in my hand. Programmability is fantastic and it has been a blast to use with SolidWorks / CAD large files without any lag. Everything about it is well designed, and I absolutely think I will have this one for many years too. If you are a heavy computer user the value of a good mouse is huge. Highly recommend.
",5
"
What really keeps this device from perfection though is the software side of things. The Logitech Options software is okay for customization, but it lacks certain features that makes no sense. By default the thumb resting button press is set to TASK VIEW, however when I want to customize the gestures I cannot select TASK VIEW as one of the options available.Also there is a bug probably in the current version that makes some of the buttons double click in every press, and this is very annoying cause the solution is to unpair and repair the mouse to windows.
",4
"
When I first got this mouse 6 months ago it was like flying the space shuttle - I loved it and the battery lasted for days before recharge. Now I can only use it for an hour or two after charging over night. Too bad it does not have a swappable AA battery so I could keep one in the charger. For $100 this is not worth it until they fix this very basic issue.
",2
"
I love the ergonomic design of this mouse. I work from home and am on the computer most of the day. This mouse keeps my hand from experiencing overuse pain/injuries.
",5
"
Love the functionality of the Master 3, and I adore the flow capability. Very responsive and accurate.Only drawback is the angle of holding it. Just a few more degrees would make this mouse shine in the light of ergonomics - not as steep as the MX Vertical, which takes it too far, but just a few degrees more than what the Master 3 already has.But if you're used to the dimensions of a typical mouse, the Master 3 is a wonderful addition.
",4
"
Very easy to setup on Windows and very comfortable to use. The movement is smooth and accurate which is great for my daily work. It took me a while to get used to the scroll wheel. Once you get used to it, you can toggle the free spin mode and the ratchet mode depending on your use case, which is very convenient. The battery life is also great!
",5
"
I picked this up in part because I needed something better for general use while on my laptop, it was a bonus that it is designed with designers and artists in mind and even has special profiles for Photoshop and Premiere, which is what I use my laptop for most days.It also helps that it has a good feel and has enough buttons for general gaming if I want. It has excellent battery life and the flow function is great when transferring files from my laptop to my big desktop at home and vice versa.
",5
"
As a mouse itself, i don't have any complaints. It is ergonomically good to hold, the scroll wheel is amazing to use. All the buttons including the thumb wheel can be customized. The problem i have is, all these customization requires the software to be installed in every laptop we would use. I have customized the buttons in my personal computer, but they don't work in my office laptop and i cannot install the software in my office laptop. One more negative, it doesn't have a slot to store the Logitech unifying receiver (USB dongle), every other mouse i have used in recent years have this slot and i find it very useful.

This is one of the most acclaimed mice out there. Features like Ultrafast Scrolling and Vertical scroll make this a very productivity centric tool for professionals. However, on my desk setup, which is a M1 Max Macbook Pro 16 with 64gb Memory connected to a hub which drives the mouse, a Keyboard and a 4K monitor, the Bluetooth latency is just too high. There is no option for a wired connection. You can either use the native Bluetooth pairing which is more unreliable, or via the dongle provided which improved latency to an extent but not much. The difference in overall experience is very apparent when I use the laptop by itself, the mouse movement is simply SO much better. Didn't expect this issue from this mouse, but overall everything else is 10/10.
",3
"
The latency is not there for aggressive gaming... but the drivers and overall feel for work related tasks is nearly perfect.My one ergonomic complaint is the palm drops off a bit too fast to the lower right vs Logitech Performance MX (https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Performance-Wireless-DISCONTINUED-Replaced/dp/B002HWRJBM) but 100+hrs in I am getting used to it.The side wheel and main wheel feel and operate perfectly, specially in MS Excel and Civil3D. However it is worth customizing the button/wheel functions in those programs. The default program profile is a little odd. However, that also means you can make program specific profiles, which is AWESOME when switching from Civil3D CADD to Adobe Premiere Pro video editing to Pix4D UAV processing...For the office or home office, I cannot recommend more highly.
",5
"
I love this mouse. I use this on my video editing pc and I love it. The side scroll is awesome. Being able to configure the buttons for different applications it a huge plus. Anyone that has davinci resolve know that it tends to crash if you haven't saved in awhile. So having the button configured to save I made it a habit to just click it after every change I make. The only knock I have is that if you are using on a computer without the dongle it can be sporadic.
",5
"
This is a fantastic mouse but, as hundreds of other people mentioned, there's something wrong with the scroll. It just doesn't scroll right, it wobbles, it freezes, and negatively affects my workflow. I've tried a few different software tricks to make it feel like it is supposed to feel, but it still doesn't work well. If I pay over $100 for a mouse, I, at least, expect the scroll to work properly. I'm looking forward to Logitech to fix the issue ASAP, but until then this mouse is unusable for a lot of people.
",1
"
Wish this lived up to the hype, but unfortunately the scroll wheel eventually was a deal breaker. It's great for going through pages quickly, until you need to stop and move around accurately. The freewheel would just bounce around, and prevented controlled use like when you want to scroll smaller amounts.Ergonomics and functionality otherwise we're great. Wish it could have worked out.

I have to say there’s a lot of getting used to this if you’ve used the original model.And it may seem like it’s not comfortable. But as you use it more and more, it’s amazing how you don’t even notice you’re holding it in your hand as it’s very very lightweight.A word of warning, be sure to keep in mind the price as it’s quite expensive.But if money isn’t an issue, I’d highly recommend it

Absolutely love this mouse. About to start a new job and I'll be on the computer for a majority of the day. Thought I should look into investing in a quality mouse and this is it. It is fairly pricey but totally worth it. I'm in love. Mind you I also don't normally leave reviews on products, but this mouse just has such a good feel I had to say something. 10/10 Recommend.

Purchased this along with a slew of other things for a new home office setup. Every part of it feels extremely high quality. The scroll wheels are, or appear to be, metal, which gives a nice tactile feel to them. Also love the ability to jump between devices which will come in handy as I work from multiple laptops. Yes, a little pricey for a mouse but for the quality and functionality, it will certainly pay for itself.

My husband ordered it for work. Great ergonomic use. His wrist does not hurt. Very practical to work fast.

I was a bit hesitant at first because it looks a little funny and/or big, but having used it I now don't like using other mouses, even ones from logitech. Really full featured. My only complaint would be the momentum of the scroll wheel, but honestly that's pretty minor.

It's a great mouse BUT...1. the scroll stutters and also it is not consistent!2. the side buttons are located too low! and my thumb touches them which is uncomfortable to work at least for me!! I wish the side buttons were placed a little higher!

I am done with this thing. For the past year it's been intermittently losing connection and I've tried all the fixes I can possibly find online. Lately, I started just leaving it plugged in in hopes that the connectivity issues would resolve, but that hasn't done it either.It's to the point where I just have to toss this in a garbage/back-up pile. Had to pull out an old wired unit just to restart my PC and write this review.I don't know if it's Logitech. I don't know if it's Bluetooth. But whatever it is, it interrupts my work too often. This was a waste of money but did help me learn that I'm going back to a USB wired connection and avoiding using Bluetooth for this kind of peripheral.I know it's got great reviews on here. I know all the YouTube influencers rate it highly. Because that's why I bought it. What a steaming pile of horse manure. The periodic connectivity issues interrupt my work and it's just unacceptable. This like mice and keyboards should get out of the way and let users get things done. But this garbage does the opposite. If you want an annoying high-maintenance device barking at you and blocking your flow, get this hot garbage. Okay, flame over. You've been warned.

This mouse replaced my MX Master 25. I like the new application-specific features, and the thump-accessible control layout is more intuitive. Two defaults need to be switched, making the button below the wheel the middle button and pressing the wheel to be mode-shift between free and click. Otherwise, it's great out of the box.FWIW, I hope the things that contact skin are easier to clean. Time will tell.

I bought this mouse after reading several good reviews. To be honest, I like the mouse. It has compatibility with both Mac and Windows with several pre-programmed profiles. It’s ergonomic. Build Quality is very good. The only reason I gave it a 3 star was due to serious lag issues due to Bluetooth technology used in the unifying receiver (dongle). I don’t use it for gaming. But I would imagine that it would be an even bigger frustration for gamers.I was trying to open several email attachments. However, the lag and freeze of the mouse were so bad that it took me 10 mins just to click on 9 email attachments and download. And it was a time sensitive work email that I had to respond to. I was so frustrated that I was about to chuck the mouse at the monitor screen. Instead, I just ordered a Logitech G502 “Wired” mouse today on Amazon on sale for $40. Expecting to receive it in the next couple of days.

I used the original MX Revolution for years, skipped the MX Performance due to the scroll wheel, picked up the MX Master 2S, and now it looks like I'm skipping this generation as well.Compared to the MX Master 2S:Pros:* USB C!  I was really excited for this, so I'm pretty bummed that I'm returning the mouse.* Better, quieter scroll wheel.  They nailed it on this mouse.  Feels amazing, very similar to Microsoft's Surface Precision mouse.Cons:* Ergonomics, specifically:* Narrower, to the point that my ring and pinky fingers drag.  Unlike the 2S which felt great, this mouse is uncomfortably small for my hand.  This is the main reason I'm returning it.* Worse ""grip"" button.  On the 2S, you could apply pressure on the entire thumb pad.  With the 3, there's a small, somewhat awkwardly-placed divot that forces you to either grip the mouse uncomfortably or press the thumb pad with the side of your knuckle instead of your fingertip.I've ended up ordering a second 2S for work instead.  Bonus that it's cheaper due to being the older version, I guess, but that didn't factor into my decision at all.

I have never spent this much money for a mouse, but I am so glad I pulled the trigger. I was experiencing a lot of wrist fatigue and this mouse has completely alleviated that problem. I have not yet learned all the functions so can't speak to that. It was worth the price and the battery goes a long time before needing a charge. I noticed some reviews talked about problems with dropping Bluetooth connection, I have not had that problem.

Very high quality and I would definitely recommend to a friend. I feel like a man when I use this mouse. This mouse doesn't just do the job, it owns the job. The mouse itself makes me a more complete person. With the mx keyboard alongside it, I could type and click all day long. All day long. Buy this.

I had to replace my Logitech Performance MX mouse after many years of reliable service and the MX Master 3 looked like the best choice for me. I'm not a gamer and spend most of my time in spreadsheets. For me, it' was definitely the right choice. I've had it for a few months now and have only charged it once. It feels very comfortable and the buttons are all placed conveniently. I'm very pleased with it.and would highly recommend it..

Not only has this thing not impressed a lick, it hurts my hand to use it.  I have medium to large sized hands for a 5'3.5"" woman.Worst part is that apparently, I didn't review the price when I bought it.  I thought it was $50 and I didn't realize if a product hurts you to use it, so what, 30 days has passed-- no return. I can't believe Amazon won't consider a return for products that are painful to use.  I'm pretty ticked and plan on NOT buying much from Amazon again, if I can help it.

Over one hour of chat to try a fix an problem. The Tech sent me link after link after link that had nothing to do with my mouse. Her direction to click on links on the web pages she had me click on - did not exist. The delay in my responses and her's were several minutes.Over one hour. I have owned many Logitech items over the years. The device worked fine for three months and then it didn't.Tech's trouble shooting didn't fix the issue.I requested a new mouse. I supplied my info she requested to obtain a new mouse.The tech told me that my request would have to go through serveral reviews to see if a replacement would be authorized.Man, Logitech Tech support trouble shooting is worse than the device problems.Next time, if a Logitech item breaks.....I will just buy a similar product from another supplier.Based on their tech support, I will never buy another product from them.A warranty is only good if the Tech support person knows what they are doing.

Finally stopped waiting for it to go on sale and bit the bullet for $99.  Replaced an MX Revolution - had bought 3 of them used since production stopped in 2007.  This one seems to have fewer buttons, but the 'gestures' makes one button into several - for example set the scroll wheel to media gesture button and tapping will pause; holding the button while moving up/down/left/right will do volume and next/prev track.  Each button can be worth 5 buttons with gestures.  You can also set buttons to do different things in different apps (I didn't).  Ergonomics is comparable to the one I kept paying a lot to get used, maybe better...  Very pleased.

So far this mouse works fine but I have for few weeks only. I can easily switch control between 3 devices which I use simultaneously (yes, I have 3 computers I work with all the time).My year-old m720 triathlon stopped working after a year. So I bought this one as its replacement. I will see how long this one will work.

Using this mouse for gaming is a disgusting meme. It has a low polling rate and just has way too much latency to ever be really accurate. Not only that, you can buy a much better gaming mouse for it at a higher price. It's a productivity mouse that has a lot of built-in functions for apps. Use it for work. If you want to game and work, just buy an ergonomic gaming mouse. Better yet, buy both of them for different purposes.

The ergonomics are excellent once you're used to it. You may need a few hours to get used to the sensitivity before it's really comfortable.

This electromagnetic combo-wheel is awesome, and the side scrolling wheel works about 50% of the time.  The right-mouse button is overly sensitive and you cannot rest anything on it without false-clicks. And it still feels like cheap plastic.  I dunno what they could do to improve on that, but for 99 bucks, the false-clicks and lightweight feeling are underwhelming.At the current price-point, I would NOT say it is 3x better than my Logitech Marathon Mouse, for 30 bucks.And FYI, the side-scrolling wheel isn't supported by every app.  In fact a lot of them don't support it at all, and the ones that do vary wildly in their implementation.  Some will be slower than molasses to scroll left and right, while others like Excel are so hyper-fast, it is almost unusable.Sticking with my 3-star rating.It's a solid 4 if it were half the price.

This mouse solves all the issues with the original MX. The original MX mouse side buttons were impossible to find without lifting your hand off the mouse and ""feel"" for them. MX 3 , ain't no searching. Lift your thumb slightly, there you go. BAM. This will save me a lot of time. This was my biggest issue with the original MXThe texture of the mouse and flywheel.. omg. feels like a Bently in my hand. Thanks, Logitech!

I've used an original MX Master 1 for four years. It's a great mouse. The new MX Master 3 mouse has a few deal breakers: the scroll wheel magnet vibrates so much it hurts my index finger, the buttons (particularly the thumb gesture button) are harder to press, the shape feels slightly worse in the hand, the polling rate is actually lower than previous models, and it feels even sweatier than my original MX Master.However, if the MX Master 3 were my FIRST MX Master mouse I might have been ok with it, but for now I will resort only to the 1/2s if I need a replacement. But MX Master model should last a very long time under heavy use so you won't have a real need to replace it.

"
Although I just returned it (big hassle to do so). It's still a great mouse my only reason for returning it was I didn't realize I already had an extra one. I really do love this mouse and I spend close to 5 hours a day using a mouse in photoshop.

While this mouse is very nice and great for ergonomics with a lot of features, Logitech still has not been able to overcome the bluetooth connectivity issues they have had for most all their mice. I had the same issue with the MX2. Hence the 3 star rating.First day out of the package it paired and worked great. The next morning, the mouse sporadically connected and disconnected from bluetooth. My PC showed as paired but flickered back-and-forth to connected. Turned the mouse off and back on, unpaired and repaired and still no joy. Software is updated but no cure there either. For a $100 mouse you would think they would have things worked out. I can only use it with the included dongle. If you don't mind not being able to rely on the bluetooth feature then this is a great mouse.
",3
"
A year later and I still love this mouse. I haven't come across a single issue I can complain about. I use it for more than 8 hours a day. I've gone for a few months without charging. Battery life is nothing you'll have to worry about with this product. Works on most surfaces except clear glass due to the technology. The mouse is activated by covering the laser to create darkness.

"
Updated from the MX Master 2S because that version used rubber around the thumb wheel and it started to come off.  The MX 3 is just as good and no longer uses rubber around the wheel but machined metal.  My one complaint is that the mouse is just so darn slippery.  Maybe that will change with more use.

This looks like an ergonomic mouse on the picture, but appears to be designed for men with large hands. Unlike a previous Logitech flagship and competitors, the mouse does not have a smooth curve that would accommodate most hand sizes. A large bump in the middle will feel just right for someone 6' and taller, or if you like to hold your hand suspended in midair.
",3
"
Fits my abnormally large hands great, but I let it charge one night and it shut off for good.I know of at least 8 of these owned between my friends and the studio and that problem has never happened, but they also say they’ve never charged it yet.My takeaway, charge it in short bursts of 5-10 minutes occasionally and that should be plenty

 Really, pay attention.After being bombarded all over social media how awesome this mouse is, and having already the matching mechanical keyboard I decided to buy this mouse for my mac.Terrible decision, I have to admit. The mouse has a terrible polling rate, if it was a computer game I would say it runs at 20fps, just horrible; it seems to get fixed at times but then goes back to broken.And the scroll oh, you're getting nowhere with that. I tried to google an answer, but all I found was other people complaining about the same issue and Logitech support either washing their hands with a support articles that don't even apply to the software that is used with the mouse, or just saying they passed the feedback to their team.The issues do seem to be specific to mac, as I tested it on a Windows computer and it seems to be working fine, which I don't really get, as my windows only Razer deathadder V2 works amazingly well with no OS support whatsoeverIn short, if you bought this mouse and you have a mac, better go ahead and request a return label. I unfortunately can't, as I shipped it abroad.I find stupefying with how long this mouse has been out, that no solution has been presented for it, be it a software or firmware upgrade. Considering how its fine on windows, hardware it most certainly isn't.In the video attached this review can be appreciated how the Razer mouse scrolls (first one) vs the MX Master 3S.

I like Logitech mice which I use with my Mac through a Bluetooth connection.  My previous mouse was a Logitech MX Anywhere 2S.  While I was very happy with this mouse, its vertical scrolling, using its mouse wheel, left much to be desired, especially when I tries to use it with any of my web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome) or Microsoft Excel.  My new Logitech MX Master 3, although bulkier, offers me better functionality especially with vertical scrolling.  This purchase met my expectations.

Tracks very smooth and reliably on any reasonably flat surface. Switching between free-wheel and ratcheting modes on the main wheel came in more handy than I thought. The optional Logitech mouse software provides outstanding customization of the mouse buttons and wheels for individual programs, you can even invert the scroll direction for the thumb and/or main wheel. Switching between computers is really easy.

If I could give this mouse more stars, I would.

Bought the MX Master 3 after my original MX Master finally gave out on me. I really wish I had made this upgrade earlier! It has the same capabilities of the MX Master, but way more comfortable with the grip. Plus with the Bluetooth capability, I finally don't have to carry the Logitech dongle around anymore. Really glad I got this!

This is really great mouse. Feels right, not cheap, weights right, but... There's one thing that made me return it - the wheel and how it acts. The wheel is silent and can spin almost forever and this leads to usability problems like: you spin the wheel to i.e. scroll the web page in browser, then you move your pointer over to other browser or terminal window, press qualifier like i.e. ALT and.... you got your font size instantly increased from 12px to 200px just because you forgot to manually stop the wheel from spinning and ALT+wheel is combination for zoom. Even I knew how this works it sill happened multiple times to me, on literally daily basis. It is extremely annoying and overshadows all the joy you can otherwise get by using this mouse. Other (minor) issue is that there's a special button located on thumb rest area that you are supposed to press with your thumb. But it is located so odd, that using thumb tip is uncomfortable and thumb joint is odd. Sad but I returned it. Will git a try when they release  MX 4 though.

It's excellent in all its features, it's a bit pricey but if it lasts, I won't have buyer's remorse.I would have rather had a replacement for my G700s but this is growing on me. The battery is by far better than the G700s and I'm getting used to the button arrangement. I used the tilt scroll wheel to scroll horizontally on the G700s but I'm finding the side scroll on the MX3 is just as good. The scroll wheel itself is faster and smoother which is another plus. There was more programmability for each button on the G700s and I'm hoping that's going to improve in the software for the MX3

The Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse is pricey but it's a very good mouse.It's more comfortable than my Logitech M720 Triathlon.PROS:Works on 3 different devices.Very comfortableWorks well on various surfaces.CONS:Rather Pricey.Battery Life could be longer.Button to switch between 3 different devices is inconveniently located on the bottom of the MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse.  The M720 had the device selector button top left side and was a much more convenient.

Thumb wheel and Gesture button on thumb rest completely unusable on Windows 7. DPI set very low out of the box and unadjustable requiring a lot of movement to travel the width of my 1080p screen. These features require the Logi Options+ software which has NO SUPPORT for Windows 7.The MX Master 3S seemed like it would have been a nice upgrade from my old faithful Performance Mouse MX which was starting to show it's age. Unfortunately, the functionality available while paired with a Windows 7 PC is that of a $9 mouse, not a $99 mouse. For those still on Windows 7, this is an absolute no-go and instant return. Sad.

This is the best investment that I have made into increasing my productivity. I highly recommend turning almost all of the buttons into gesture buttons so that you can add an extra 4 custom commands to them.The mouse feels amazing to use and definitely improves the experience of using my computer.

USED. Packaging was opened, mouse was already set up and charged, and the pads on the bottom are quite scratched. I didn't mind paying the high price for this mouse but I expected a new one. I believe some one ordered the mouse and keyboard and the returned products were separated because my dongle is for a keyboard.I love the mouse. It is a great upgrade from my MX Master original. I have only used it on my mac via bluetooth. When I try the included dongle, a screen pops up to sync a keyboard and the programing app doesn't pick up the mouse. I will try later using my old dongle.

I need to write a poor review for this device, for the sake of those who might be considering its purchase, and for Logitech to take note if it cares to hear. I relied on the MX Revolution for years until my last one finally wore out. The ""MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse"" seemed to be the best replacement option. I would agree with other reviewers that the ergonomics are a step backward and the software is dumbed down. Most disappointingly, I've found that this mouse frequently disconnects from the receiver such that the enhanced featureset is lost, even though it's still recognized as a basic mouse by Windows. Decided to give the connect-by-Bluetooth option a try but hours later Bluetooth completely disappeared in Device Manager, which persistently reported ""Unknown USB device (device descriptor request failed)"" despite attempted uninstalls/driver updates/etc. Via email rather than telephone per their request, Logitech's technical support department seemed like children without their parents around, lacking any accountability. They requested, reasonably, the various specs, like ""Operating system version, edition, and build,"" to which I replied ""Windows 10 Pro, Version 1909, OS Build 18363.657,"" but their response was ""Thanks for getting back. Please confirm your computer operating system."" I asked for a supervisor's involvement; Logitech Customer Support suggested I conduct troubleshooting. Of course I had already documented running the recommended algorithm without resolution. Through my own independent research I was at last able to restore Bluetooth functionality on a suggestion to temporarily unplug the power cord, of all things.

I can’t emphasize enough the importance of a good mouse.  I had an Apple Magic Mouse and HATED it.  The MX Master 3 is worth it.

Out of nowhere I now only have two working wireless profiles. The first does not connect to Bluetooth or the Bolt receivers while the second and third profiles work entirely fine.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? I'm just here to basically confirm that what other people are saying about this mouse is true. The experience I've had using this mouse with Logitech Flow: seamless. I use it between my MacBook Pro and my Windows NUC. It makes the perfect pair to my MX keyboard, I had to buy both.

While I love this mouse on my Macbook Pro, I have been getting into troubles with this mouse on the Windows. It does not run smoothly on the Windows operating system. It stopped working while I was taking the midterm exam for my graduate program. It is really great product in Mac OS. However, on the Windows, the experience was not the same. I tried to search for the solution online but there wasn't much troubleshooting procedures I could follow. I know the bluetooth can be flaky in Windows. However, I also bought a Keychron keyboard, which runs on bluetooth. I use both devices for my Macbook Pro and my Windows Desktop. It is the only the mouse that is having a problem with Windows. :( If there can be any solution to this, it would be fantastic.

 A los dos meses comenzó a fallar el scroll (el que es ""pausado"") y al par de días el mouse dejó de funcionar. Solo enciende una luz roja que parpadea brevemente.Me dejé guiar por tanta propaganda que los ""youtubers desarrolladores"" le hicieron a ese modelo, está demasiado sobrevalorado. Tuve que regresar a un mouse alámbrico que tengo desde hace 4 años (en su tiempo costó como $5) y aún funciona perfectamente.No lo recomiendo, por su precio no vale la pena.---Según lo que he podido averiguar, pueda ser que la batería esté dañada.Estoy pensado en que si realmente vale la pena comprar la batería por $15 (más envío), y en el caso que funcione `va a durar sólo dos meses más?`, me entristese haber tirado $100 a la basura

I bought it specifically for the scroll wheel, and it didn't disappoint.  The button near the scroll wheel lets you turn off the clicky steps so it's very smooth.  It has weight, so you can fling it to jump very far.  I wasn't sure what I would think about the thumb rest, but it doesn't annoy me.  I wish the whole thing was a bit lighter, and picking it up requires retraining and effort to use the ribbed texture instead of the underside lip.

Right out of the box it was a dream, but let’s face facts if you close your eyes for an hour something new and better seems to hit the market. I just like it. It’s a first for me to have a mouse with both Bluetooth or radio (usb fob).

The mouse in the white gray color picks up dirt quickly and it looks disgusting.  I clean it every week and I can't get the stains out. For such an expensive item it looks now cheap. Very disappointed with the construction.  It is a great mouse but the fact is gets dirty so quickly it is not worth it. Total waste of money.

Let me start off by saying I purchased this coming from my MX Anywhere 2S for the ergonomics. I love the gesture button for easy navigation on my Macbook. Pairing it with bluetooth was fine but after that was it was a nightmare. I gave it two weeks, but it was awful.This was the absolute worst tracking mouse I've used in 20+ years. The cursor was jumpy (to the point where it would give me a headache following it). When moving the mouse slowly, the cursor would jump/skip slightly. Increasing the speed would increase the distance the cursor would jump/skip. It didn't matter if I was using it on bluetooth or using the provided USB. I reset the NVRAM, did several restarts, changed my tracking settings, nothing fixed it.There also has to be some kind of built in acceleration, I've gone through all the settings and couldn't find anything, and I also disabled mouse acceleration on my system, yet, it still persists.

Quality Product, just not for me. As like anything Logitech makes, especially the MX series, it is all very high quality. Used this mouse for a week at work and just didn't like it personally.

The functions on this are great. It seems like a lot to spend on a mouse and it is...but it’s worth it! For someone like myself who spends their week in front of a computer all day a comfortable mouse with extra features that let you perform faster and makes everything simpler is a must have. I don’t regret this purchase at all. It was recommended by a family member and I’m glad I splurged.

The big selling point is the scroll wheel. In older logitech mice with metal scroll wheels, you pressed a button to switch back and forth between ratchet mode and free spinning mode. But with this, you don't have to do that. It's ratchet when you go slowly, and then if you spin it hard, it goes into free spinning. You might have to try it to appreciate how nice that it. Very easily the best mouse I've had in decades of using mice. I don't use it for games, so I can't comment on that, but for regular PC work, it's great.
",5

Update: I'm having a major issue with this mouse where every few minutes or so the polling rate drops drastically and it becomes very unresponsive for 5-10 seconds. It sounds minor, but makes it really tedious to use as I'm constantly having to stop what I'm doing.Pros:Overall the MX3 feels great in your hand (no double entendre's here) and is generally wonderful to use. It has a nice weight that makes if feel very sturdy without hindering movement. The battery life is also quite nice, though we'll see how that ages. The gesture button is also a bit strange, but an interesting idea. I'm just not sure how much mileage I'll end up getting out of it.Cons:I'm really not a fan of the scroll wheel. It's very quiet which is nice, but actually using it to scroll is more painful than even the cheapest mice I've used. Even in locked mode it will start free-wheeling if you scroll fast enough, which is strange considering it also has an unlocked mode that functions the same. It also starts to feel really weird to use in the middle ranges and it leads to this weird feeling where you can't really accurately predict how far you're going to scroll down.  I also find myself really missing the ability to switch DPI profiles easily (like with the G903) when I hop into a game.

Like I said in the title, this is the last mouse you’ll need. This thing has features up the wazoo.

If you have any doubts, throw them away and buy this thing, you’ll love it.

Much better than the Apple Magic Mouse. Mostly because it actually contours naturally to the way your hand will lay and you can charge it *while using it*.Knocked off one star because the gesture button is a bit oddly placed and difficult to push. Otherwise, this mouse is nearly perfect.

I like this mouse but the software is so buggy.After customizing the buttons, sometimes something happens with the Logitech Options software running in the background that nothing works the way it was configured.  All the Logitech processes have to be killed and restarted for it to work again.  It's the worst.Sometimes the buttons do double clicks or have delayed clicks after they're pressed.  In a browser, click the back button is like hitting the back button in the browser twice.  I set the thumb button to be the Enter key, yet sometimes when I click it, it opens up the virtual desktops in Windows.  Not even remotely close to the behavior of hitting the Enter key.  After double checking to see if the button configuration was reset, it still shows as configured for the Enter key behavior.When it works, it's great.  Just wish there wasn't a need for the Logitech Options software to be running in order for customized buttons to function the way they're configured.

Eztremely happy. I uograded from a $30 mouse and the difference is huge.

I’ve used a lot of mouses (or mice as they call them). This has to be one of the better ones though I’m not surprised because Logitech has been a producer of good input devices for a long time. All the buttons and controls work as you would like, it’s very comfortable in the hand, easily programmable buttons. Just a good mouse overall, highly recommended. Oh and it doesn’t take up a lot of USB slots because I can share the transmitter between a Logitech keyboard and this mouse. The Logitech keyboard, the master MX is also awesome!

It was great until it completely stopped working for no apparent reason after 6 months.  Now the mouse will not charge or turn on at all.  Logitech support is completely useless and their website for filing warranty claims does not function.  Purchase from another manufacturer if you don't want to have to buy a new one in 6 months.

It has a great battery (more than 2 months), extremely ergonomic and great wireless response. You just need to consider if you are comfortable with the size of the item.

I can't believe what I've been doing with my life without this mouse, I'm a developer who uses the computer at least 8 hours a day and this mouse is the most comfortable mouse I have ever used. It is super ergonomic (which is the reason I switched from the magic mouse). And has many options that make your life easier. Best mouse for MacOS and Windows.The only thing that I could have changed was to include a compartment for the USB receiver in the mouse.

Bought this for my work machine and am so spoiled by it I just bought a 2nd one for my gaming laptop. Solid feel and the scroll wheel has to be experienced to understand why it's perfect. Really interesting magnetic clutch in there that gives you fine control and a ""fast flick"" spin that can zoom through to the end of a document almost instantly. Some really useful side-scrolling and other features as well. Highly recommend.

I was hesitant to spend so much on a mouse, but so happy I did! This mouse makes everything so much easier with the super fast scrolling and the ergonomic feel. I have smaller hands, so I use a beaded wrist pad and it's perfect. Best mouse ever!

This mouse is perfect for work and productivity. Love it!

After seeing this same mouse being used by multiple video editors, I finally bit the bullet and got one for myself. And I have no regrets. This thing is smooth, the scrolling is smooth, and having the side buttons is very nice. It works, and it's comfortable.

Everything good that people are saying about this mouse is true. I have relatively large hands and it is comfortable and feels great even when using it for long hours coding. The only thing I don’t like and the reason I gave it 4/5 stars is that the left button now makes a springy sound whenever I click it. It’s a little loud and at times annoying.  Other than that the mouse has been great!

It feels good and the horizontal scroll is perfect.

When you spend as much time on the computer as I do, a good mouse is essential.  My last Logitech lasted 10 years.  Bought it here on Amazon as well.  All buttons and controls are placed well.  This thing will read off of any surface.  Very ergonomic.  Feels great.Logitech costs more, but it is so worth it.
",5
"
I absolutely love this. It is so worth the money. My wrists done hurt anymore. I was a little skeptical because of the price but blimey is it perfect.It is THE MOST ERGONOMIC mouse if you work at a desk.

First, the product is nice. The buttons, feel, packaging, everything else about the mouse is very good. However, if you plan to use this as a Bluetooth mouse, in one word, don't.I have had this now for a handful of weeks. Foolishly, I discarded the packaging (and the USB dongle) or I would return this. The BT mouse continues to stop working when the screen saver comes on (password screen required for work laptop). I've invested quite a lot of time searching the web (and the Logitech website). There is abundant information on updating drivers (and uninstalling/re-installing Bluetooth drivers), insuring that services for BT is set to ""automatic,"" and using device manager to insure that the BT interface isn't permitted to power off to save power (you'll see it in device manager Bluetooth). In addition, I noted that there is a new entry Bluetooth Low Energy GATT in ""Human Interface Devices""  with a similar setting. The web suggested a change to the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion) changing it from 6.3 to 6.2. After all the above (and contacting Logitech), nothing seems to work. So, I have a $100 paperweight as unpairing and re-pairing each time I walk away from the computer us absurd.Again, if you desire to use this as a BT mouse (as I did in my case having a laptop with very few USB connections and did not want to carry a USB hub) don't buy this product.It may not be fair to give this one star as this may have more to do with Windows 10 than the mouse itself. But, it just seems that something this flaky should not be offered as a potential use model. The really peculiar thing is that I was using another BT mouse (Logitech) that after some years began to fail that never exhibited these symptoms.

Picked up this mouse after wanting an upgrade from my MX Anywhere 2S. I liked most everything about this mouse except for the scroll wheel. I was skeptical about all of the reviews pointing out issues with the scroll wheel; however, it really is that bad (for me at least). I tried configuring the scroll wheel to try and get it feeling good to no avail. The input is very inconsistent, especially when trying to make fine movements.It's a shame, I love the mouse otherwise but the scroll wheel makes this mouse unusable for me.  I had to return it and stick with my MX Anywhere 2S.

Excellent hardware, great performance and extremely productive. Button customization is great and enhances productivity significantly. Apps become much more convenient and fun to use.

The mouse could be bigger for ergonomics, but it is better than my Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic mouse. So far it has proven tough and reliable having fallen twice with no apparent damage.

"
Yes, it's a great mouse. And I got the Logitech MX Mechanical Mini Wireless keyboard at the same time.I was under the impression that both would work using the one Logi Bolt receiver. This is not how it works and you need a Logi Bolt USB receiver for each device. Very sad about that.This would be an easy 5-star review if these could use the same receiver like the items that use the ""unify"", and give me back a USB port!

The best mouse ever

Love this mouse! Saved me from a KVM. I can bounce between my desktop and laptop with a simple click. Love the USBC to charge instead of AA batteries. Feels great in my hand and feels very fast. I heard it isn't great for gaming, but i haven't felt any lag so far.
",5
"
So good that I had to buy one for my home computer.  Customizable to work differently in different programs like CAD, ArcGIS, Adobe Acrobat DC , and automatically switches to standard button layout for Google Chrome.

"
I went from a Goldtouch ergo vertical mouse to this one. This mouse feels more comfortable in my hand, and I think my clicking accuracy is much better now. I'm not sure long the battery lasts yet, but I give it an overnight charge I've a week. The build quality sense better than the Goldtouch as well.
",5
"
I was so excited to get this and try out all of the features.  Unfortunately, it actually became painful to use because I learned I have ""small hands"".  My husband is using it now and loves it.  Wish it came in different sizes like some other brands.

Dig that title? It’s the best out there. Don’t even ask any questions, go grab yours! It’s worth it.

When you have Logitech options software installed and when it is working, it's fanastic!  You can seamlessly switch from PC to PC by merely moving your mouse.  However, I found that it only works about 80% of the time.  The other 20%, you have to manually switch.  Why is the switch at the bottom of the mouse?  You now need to pick up the mouse and turn it over to switch it. I am constantly switching between the 2 PCs, so this is a hassle I don't want to deal with.  At least they could have included software to relocate the button.  If switching worked 95% of the time and the switch button was on top, I would give it 5 stars.

"
This is a great mouse! For me it's the free spin wheel that makes all the difference. Combined with the ergonomic shape of the body it's ideal for long hours working on the computer. Installation is as simple as plugging in the usb dongle. Unlike my logi keyboard this dongle has quite some range and never gives me any trouble. Battery charges last for a very long time. I recharge it every few weeks.
",5
"
I sent this back weeks ago and still haven't been refunded by Amazon! I used the amazon locker and not a single email or confirmation. Very shady if you ask me and no confirmation or anything after this long means I have to contact them,,, again...The mouse has micro stutters that drives you crazy and the IR has to be plugged into a usb 2 port which is getting more rare these days as we move passed even usb 3. I did have a slot however after removing another item that needed usb 2 and the stutters were just too much to deal with. Back to a nice, smoooooth plug in mouse that doesn't care where it's plugged in.

"
Feels slightly lighter. Spins faster and smoother. The back and forward buttons are in more logical positions. I had to get this due to a few improvements, but also for the usb-c charging connector. I purchased the new MX Master Keyboard with usb-c a couple weeks ago. The MX keyboard has an advertised battery recharge cycle of 10 days. I have always kept my MX Master mouse plugged in all the time, so now, with both devices having usb-c charge receptacles, it's natural for me to put the charging cable back into the keyboard after topping of the mouse now and then. Great ergo, Logi.

The Logitech Options software lets you tweak every little detail about this mouse. Everything is high-quality and the software is top-notch. Logitech software can sometimes not be great, but I can say that the software for this mouse is great.

"
I am a Logitech fan and I think this is an overall high quality mouse, but I am extremely unhappy with the scroll wheel and I will be returning it. The wheel is very inconsistent, sometimes not responding to a movement and sometimes jumping way too much for the exact same movement. Very often I see a backwards scroll step. I've tried all available options, activating/disabling smooth scrolling, SmartShift, manual ratchet mode vs free scroll, it still doesn't provide a good scrolling experience. I've seen these settings randomly change from time to time by themselves, and also the extra buttons like gesture, back and forward buttons randomly stop working (they usually start working after a restart of Logi Options). It also happened once that the Logi Options Daemon (I'm on macOS) was using a lot of CPU to the point that my mac heated up and the fan turned on at full speed. Things went back to normal after I stopped the Daemon process. Most of these seem to be software issues rather than hardware.

"
I bought a new M1 Mac Mini and needed a new mouse and keyboard. I went for Logitech for both. I have the MX Master at the office and I got this for home to work remotely. I love this mouse. If you are having trouble deciding between this mouse and any other on the market, choose this one. You will not be disappointed.
",5
"
A firmware update prompted by the Logitech Options software bricked the mouse today. It is unusable and Logitech will not respond to a ticket opened on their website or call back after using that option in their telephone support queue.Logitech did eventually respond (over 3 weeks later) and provided a new firmware tool that fixed the issue.

Best Mouse i've had in my life, Great quality, arrived early, love it.

I have only been using this mouse for about two weeks and i can already say it is the best mouse i have ever come across. The shape fits the concave structure of my hand like it was meant to be there. The programmable buttons are all located perfectly for ease of access. The scroll wheel is straight out of a dream. Going from clicky to smooth scroll based on speed is extremely convenient when i am at work and need to be delicate page by page and also quick scroll. Overal 10/10.

I wanted to like this mouse, but I just can't.  Sure, it's comfortable and has all the features I was looking for, but it just doesn't work properly in a Linux environment.  I haven't used Windoze for over a decade so I used to having things not work the same.  Running Mint 20.1 this mouse will randomly stutter and freeze.  This is unacceptable while trying to edit video (or anytime really).  This product is advertised as being Linux compatible, yet there is no software from Logitech to do so.  This has been a problem with them for many years.  Check for yourself, do a search for Linux support on the Logitech website.  You will see generic canned responses and sidestepped issues among the many complaints.I also only get about a week before I need to recharge the battery, no where near the advertised life.I have a week left in my Amazon return window.  It's going back.  It's just too expensive to let it sit around unused.  I would have been fine with the price had it fully and properly worked like it was advertised to.  To charge $100 for a mouse that the company KNOWS doesn't do what they say it does is unacceptable.  This was my last ever Logitech product.  Now I have to find something else that works.  More downtime from work due to their misrepresentation of their product.

The MX Master series mouse is one of my favorite mice series. I switched from the MX Master 1 to the MX Master 3. The jump to the 3 was perfect. I really like the vertical scroll on the mouse wheel the material when scrolling feels solid and the thumb scroll button is a must for me especially when reading documents and websites. I remapped the additional buttons to open my more common applications which increases productivity for various tasks.
",5
"
I had the original MX Master for several years, in fact, I owned two. I used one for work and one for home and they both couldn't hold a charge for more than 2 weeks since the day I bought them. This mouse (again 2) is much better! Better feeling in my hand, better with the battery and works well with Bluetooth and wireless. Can't say enough good about it.
",5

I have used this mouse for few weeks now and love it except the plastic used on the main buttons is already showing significant wear. I wish they would have made those out of aluminum. For $100 it should be made out of better materials.

I bought the entire MX setup and the mouse is easily the stand out winner. Best mouse I’ve ever used. Silky smooth action with gestures. Perfectly tactile buttons that have a satisfying click. Smooth, accurate scrolling at all speeds. Easy to use secondary buttons. Most importantly, the ergonomics makes clicking all day a breeze. I deal with wrist pain from years of using awful input devices. After using this device I can honestly say it’s taken away my wrist shoulder and neck pain. I also do not get a twinge of pain with every click and scroll like I do with lesser mice.

Have owned a ton of ""mice"" since the 80's... used one for career in software/tech and this is the best, most comfortable one yet!

My favorite part of using this mouse has to be its capability of switching seamlessly from one computer to another. It's especially useful when using my laptop with a mic and camera for my zoom class and my desktop for homework at the same time and not needing two mice. The built in and customizable buttons and side scroller are in very accessible positions and makes gaming better.

I've tried several ergonomic mouses for my arthritic thumb joint.  This one feels great, no issues with prolonged use! I feels great in your hand - very natural. The horizontal scroll feature is cool. The vertical scroll is almost too fast.

This is a great Mouse. You can customize all the buttons, works via BT and USB. The only caveat for me, is that the mouse is a little bit heavy

Sometimes the mouse is laggy and scrow/side buttoms doesnt work at all! I have the latest firmware/software installed. Can't believe it! It's a simple mouse and Logi has failed to make such simple thing work.

Worked great until it didn’t (right after refund window closed.) Now, no matter if it’s connected directly or just wirelessly, the lag is so horrible I switched back to my laptop’s mouse pad. I love the design and other features but it’s basically useless now.

This is a mouse that is getting awesome reviews on various sites, so maybe my expectations were too high. My main application is office use. I was looking for a mouse that would fit my hands better than a previous generation Logitech Anywhere that died on me recently.Ergonomics: there is a thumb rest integrated to the mouse. It didn't work for me as the friction where the thumb rest is noticeable after a couple of hours of regular use. Also, the horizontal scrolling wheel is not naturally easy to reach, sames things for the thumb buttons, when the hand is resting on the mouse and the thumb on the thumb rest.Feel: the mouse feels too heavy.,The worst thing is the main scrolling wheel. When the ratchet is on, you can feel the (loose?) magnets rattling and bouncing off. This completely disappears when the ratchet is off, but it was a deal killer for me. I even suspected there was actually a defect with the mouse I got. Apparently, unlike the new Anywhere 3 mouse, you cannot adjust how hard the ratchet notches feel. Also, the new Anywhere 3 doesn't exhibit the rattling/bouncing behavior, although it has the same automatic freewheeling SmartShift feature as the Master 3.Noise: the rattling & bouncing sound of the wheel in ratchet mode was really annoying to me. Maybe there was a defect with the unit I had.I returned the mouse suspecting a defect and ordered the Anywhere 3 model that is perfect.

For me the number one feature for a mouse is ergonomics. This mouse just feels great in my hand! The placement of the buttons are well thought out and it just works great. I use this mouse for work (CAD/CAM) but I would think it would also be a good gaming mouse. I only had it for 2 weeks and the battery has not needed a recharge. Good job LOGI, great design!

I'm using this mouse with an iMac and I can tell you, without doubt, this is the best mouse I've ever used. It's sturdy and well built and the scroll wheels work perfectly.The only slight complaint is the back and forward buttons are a bit hard to press but it doesn't bother me that much.All in all, a great mouse.

The buttons and wheel feel really smooth. I have been using it now for 4 weeks and still have not had to recharge it.I cannot say anything about gaming as I don`t use it for that. But I understand lots of people use it for flight simulators.

I bought this as a general purpose desktop PC mouse, and it fills the bill nicely. Everything works as expected, and was easy to install. It is good ergonomically, and I am still on the initial battery charge after several weeks of frequent use. (Using with the included USB wireless choice - have not tried the Bluetooth.) I love that I no longer have to hassle with a mouse tail in the way on my desktop. Have not used with games, so can't rate for that use.

Another great mouse from Logitech. This mouse is comfortable and easy to use. The USB-C charging makes it easy to keep charged up and the battery life is fantastic. There are so many way to customize the various buttons through the app and it is compatible with just about any device.

I use the mouse for everyday office tasks -- Word, Excel, mail, etc. -- as well as for more precise & demanding work -- photo post-processing, CAD (multiple platforms), etc.  I's accuracy & speed are excellent & the plug-in charging is very beneficial.  Great product!

I use it for work and the mouse shape is great. The middle scroll wheel is super fast and spins forever. Really comfortable. Super responsive and the battery lasts forever. I have not used it for gaming though. I would think you would find another mouse for that. No complaints.

What a difference this mouse makes for me! I have been using a flat mouse and have been having some hand pain in my thumb joint and fatigue from being at my computer all day.  This mouse has help tremendously.  It takes the stress off my hand and I could really tell the difference from day one.  Also...it looks cool and I like the ratchet scrolling roller.

I have three computers that I use in my home office, two Apple Macminis and a Dell XPS PC. The three computers utilize just one keyboard (the Logitech MX Keys Keyboard) and one mouse (the MX Master 3) which are located on my desk. I also have one Viewsonic 27"" display on the desk. The display is switched between computers using a 3 input HDMI switch. This arrangement makes it very easy to switch between computers while using only one keyboard, one mouse, and one display. It works great!!

Replaced my decade old MX Performance mouse that I loved until it wasn't tracking anymore. This mouse works as well as the old mouse (better probably!) is much lighter, and can easily swap between my 2 laptops. The bluetooth connection means no more fear of losing the little dongle bit, and I am very happy with it.

Well put together.  It has a great feel and the battery lasts forever!  Obviously, it would be nice if the dongle had a storage spot on the mouse itself.  But the feel and performance more than make up for it.

I loved this mouse for the first year or so... but there were always minor issues, like the functions not working, like side scroll, or the additional buttons. I have Logi Options software, the most recent version, everything the newest, upgraded, and my goodness I finally had to accept reality today and shout out loud, ""THIS MOUSE SUCKS!!!!"" -- I don't care how awesome it is and how much I love it when it actually works.The problem is more than 50% of the time it only functions as a normal 2 button mouse! And when that happens, I spend so much time trying to fix it, or getting annoyed and having to use my trackpad in addition to this ""2 button mouse"" in order to do things like scrolling down or side scroll.Seriously, Logitech... get your GD act together. Charge more for a mouse if you have to, but make sure it effing works! I must have spent several hours just trying to troubleshoot this mouth in 2021 alone.

This is another Logitech design win. Sure it's a premium price, but if you're going to use something 9 hours a day, it might be worth investing a few bucks Into it.The weighting is nice, the accuracy spot on, and the thumb scroll is a life saver for navigating massive spreadsheets. The  thumb buttons have a little better placement over the original MX, and hopefully, the updated gesture button will hold up longer as that's what finally gave out on my original MX Master after years of daily use.
",5
"
The latest of many Logitech mice I've used over the years, and my favorite to date.  I particularly like: the center scroll wheel options, the thumb wheel (although I don't need to use it all that often) and its application by application programmability.  It's also got a nice smooth glide, no doubt benefiting from how light it is.  I've had it for many weeks now, and only needed to plug it in for recharging once.  Having said that, I do make a point of turning it off when I'm not using it.

This mouse is able to connect to three devices simultaneously.  When using a MX Keyboard,  It's like an extended desktop when I go toward the edge of the screen it can switch computers like a transparent KVM.  I love being able to drag drop files from one computer to the other.

This is the best mouse I have ever had. I used the Logitech G602 for years, and then went to the Corsair Harpoon RGB. I wasn't happy with that and it didn't feel right.A friend recommended the MX Master series to me, and I bought it. It is by far the best mouse I have ever owned. It feels great in the hand. It fits right into your palm.Will buy the MX Master 4 when it is released.

I do mainly computer work such as 3D design and animation so I need a reliable and accurate mouse. I got tired of using all these popular ""gaming"" mice because something keeps wearing out: a button, the wheel, the sensitivity, etc.I decided to get something more professional and higher quality. This seemed like a good candidate so I gave it a try. So far I love everything about the mouse except for the fact that it cannot be used wired. You MUST use the dongle that comes with it to transmit and receive signal. You can use it while it is plugged in but it only charges the mouse, not transmit data.The problem with this is the dongle isn't accurate and secure. It randomly skips or loses signal all too often. The dongle is on my desk and about 2-3 feet from the mouse with nothing in between. It's such a pain to do work and not have the mouse do what you want it to. I was hoping to be able to use the mouse directly plugged into the computer to fix this issue but I can't.I will try a few more weeks before I decide to go for a wired mouse.

I use it with my work and personal macs.There are two very nice features that make me fully recommend it to other users.The extra buttons replace the trackpad gestures very well.The ability to sync with 3 different computers and switch between computers with the push of a button.

Even if you just use it for office work, ergonomics and button customization is incredible, BUT why in the world this mouse only got a polling rate of 125, its unresponsive, its like you are lagging while moving your mouse over the screen. Logitech mightve make an ideal mouse, but unfortunately...

This  mouse worked great for about 10 months of very light use. I used the mouse to complete my online college assignments during the school year and not so much in the summer. It was very accurate and performed smoothly but completely stopped working this fall after a month of use. I thought it just needed charging but I plugged it in nothing happened. I left it plugged in overnight and no results, after trying two other cables and other sources with no change, I contacted support. I gave the customer service agent all the information and after she found out I was using the mouse for personal use and not business, she transferred me to another agent who asked all the same questions and troubleshooting steps the other agent asked.. I sent all the information she asked for additionally like a photo of the mouse with ticket number, serial number from the mouse and not the package, all my contact information including phone number and where and when I purchased the item. Today she sends me an email asking for the same thing. I paid almost a hundred bucks for this crap. Logitech will not get my money ever again and I have a few of their products in my home. Stay away from this mouse unless you want to waste money!!!

I would give this 5 stars except for one large oversight on the engineering.  I bought this mouse and the keyboard and love them both.  The only thing I don't like is that neither work as a wired device.  I work in IT at home and work and I don't like having different keyboards for both environments.  My work does not allow wireless input devices so I have to get another keyboard and mouse for work.  I just wish Logitech would make it so their products, which can be connected via USB, would work via USB.  Otherwise, the keyboard is amazingly easy to get used to and this mouse has great functionality.  I love the ergonomics because the minute I put my hand on it I realize I have bad form with every other mouse I have used.

obviously the killer feature on the mx mater 3 is the magnetic scroll wheel--buttery smooth infinite scrolling (with option to toggle to ratcheted)---it is just awesome! also, the battery life is insane!sadly, just about everything else on the mouse is terrible:--side buttons are flat and stiff, nearly impossible to find or click quickly & consistently;--with the long battery life comes a mouse that feels like you're dragging a brick around after a few hours of work; the weight issue became unbearable for me and I just had to switch to something else

Incredibly ergonomic and great mapping software plus gesture controls. The first mouse I got had intermittent lag and it seemed unlikely to not be a hardware issue given Logitech reputation. The second mouse had no issue and is super responsive. I paint in photoshop with a combination of mouse and apple pencil via ipad pro and this is working great. I love the second scroll wheel for changing opacity. It saves me so much time in texture work.

The sole purpose of spending many dollars on the MX keys and Mouse was for the easy-switch.  Even with Flow, it does not work well.  I expected better from Logitech!  First, my mouse is not following easy-switch, second, using flow going from y stream book to Mac the Keyboard does not follow. Next the design of putting the switch button on the bottom of the mouse is a horrible idea!  At least if you are going to use software for functions, give me the option to set Duo fn to switch!Now lets just talk about flow and options.  I have a work computer that I am not allowed to installed software on.  So even if flow worked as expected I can not use for my work notebook.  Going from work notebook to mac is 98% of the switching I do.  Logitech, it would have been so much easier to have the mouse pair with keyboard and keyboard and mouse pair with computer.  Even if you have to pair both with a computer, have the keyboard ""EASY-switch"" tell the mouse to follow.   I really thought I could at least get flow and easy switch to work from my steam book and mac, but that has been fruitless as well.   Now I have wasted so much time trying to get this all to work together, I am unable to return it all.  I will be posting this as a review on Amazon.

I liked this mouse but had to return it. It was comfortable under my hand but I did not like the fact it did not have a DPI switcher, my pinky would drag on it’s side and it was too light weight wise. Otherwise the scrolling and the button clicking was awesome. It worked great in this like photoshop and editing but once I jumped into a game, I felt the drawback.

 I bought this mouse to ease my workflow for Stock Trading. I must say this offers a significant amount of workflow optimization since it saves a lot of time in placing and execution of orders (Side buttons mapped for hot keys). The item was delivered fast and sealed.

This is my second MX Master 3, great mouse all around and my top choice.This review is about the seller and a warning to others. I received this mouse in what appeared to be perfectly new packaging and had no doubts about the product and it worked out of the box, although it was odd that it was completely dead and I had to charge it but no big deal. Second day, I noticed that the pads at the bottom were very scratched, like those of a mouse with a lot of use... The rest of the mouse didn't show many signs of wear though. I didn't have any other proof that the mouse was used so i decided to keep it... Fast forward a few days and this mouse will die within 24hrs even if its turned off. That's an issue I cant live with.So just a warning. Check and make sure you are actually receiving a NEW mouse like you ordered. This was either a dishonest seller at worst, or perhaps I was sold an item that was returned to the ""as new"" and not verified.

My surface mouse gave up after one year of usage. After a bunch of research I pulled the trigger on this. So far it's been amazing, love the customizable thumb scroll!

I used a performance Mx before and I thought that was great. This is definitely an upgrade that's miles better. I didn't realize how heavy that mouse was. This mouse is light, ergonomic, and performant. I haven't tried gaming yet but i suspect it'll be great!Using it on macbook pro 15in.

Been working with it for only a couple of days, but so far it's a great mouse. Easy set up on my Win 10 machine, gave it a full charge last nite so will be tracking the battery life. It's VERY comfortable in my fat fingered hands! Alot of features I wont use, but I appreciate the fast scrolling and tactile feel of this mouse; the buttons and wheels are smooth and instantly responsive. Will post  after I have some time in with it.

I'm happy w/ this purchase.  I'm not using anything close to the capabilities of it, but like the comfort of it in my hand...the tracking of the cursor...& the overall performance of it.  Would purchase it again, if needed.

Everything that bothered me about the 2S is fixed.- The main scroll wheel has a much better feel.- Forward Thumb button much easier to use- Gestures seem better (using it for: press ""copy"", press/move ""copy""Master 3 tops the list of best mice in my experience since 1988.
",5
"
I like the ergonomic design, it fits in my hand nicely. One thing i did not like was the fact that this product would often disconnect or stutter while in use. It happened pretty often in my day to day use and got really annoying.

Charge time last for weeks; and the included charging cable makes it easy. The sidescroll wheel has become a necessity for work, and I purchased a 2nd mouse for home. Will definitely buy again.Occasional connectivity issues while gaming, so I still use a wired mouse for that application. That is the only issue.

Great features on the mouse that works Great on the Mac Mini

I like this mouse a lot, but am also a bit disappointed in it. There are several buttons that don't work as the documentation suggests, and there are some buttons that appear in the documentation but are not on the mouse. For the most part, it works well, but fast scrolling simply does not work as advertised.

Owned two prior versions of this mouse.  Each generation is better and better.  The included transceiver dongle works with the mouse and my Logitech Ergo K860.  The two look made for each other.  Saves a USB port and allows me to put the second transceiver into my laptop.

Perfect productivity mouse, just purchased this mouse a couple days ago and it’s been the best mouse I’ve ever gotten. It has intuitive features that lets you do more than just what a typical mouse does. I greatly would recommend for productivity uses.

Great mouse until it suddenly died after 19 months. Simply will not start. No lights. Not a charge issue.  No trauma of any sort. Was simply sitting on my desk. Logitech support says I am SOL.  No reboot option and now out of warranty.  This appears to be a popular mouse. Curious if others have experienced the same short lifespan.
",2
"
I never knew what I was missing. I've never had an expensive mouse before. This one was easily twice what I've ever paid in the past. Worth every penny. Comfortable to use. Very responsive and accurate. I use it mostly for browsing, but also for several hours of work on Fusion 360 where it really shines. I'm not a gamer so can't speak to that.  Last game I played was pong and that was when it connected to a television--no home computers existed.

I've used many mice over the decades.  This is now my #1 choice and I'll never use another.  Just spend the money already so you can enjoy it.

I'm an iOS Developer and bought this mouse for work use with my MacBook Pro.Its a mess, they shouldn't even be calling it compatible.First of all, it's been what - 5 years or more - and Logitech still could not possibly care less about a USBC adapter for MacBooks. I have to use a dongle or dock depending on where I am working, and it sucks.Second, I usually need my MacBook on my left of my monitors, because I am right handed, so mouse, coffee, headphones, notebook etc are on the right hand side of my desk. Even this separation between mouse and receiver  (or bluetooth, which is worse) on occasion will cause dropouts.But the biggest problem is that when my MacBook is working hard - on XCode compiles. or loading storyboards - the mouse just floats around undetached from my movements until the CPU calms down - its is INFURIATING for a mouse this expensive on a quad-core MacBookPro with 16 GB RAM.Just dont buy it - this mouse isnt that special, its ergonomic, has back and forward buttons, a scroll wheel - big deal, most mice do. Its not reliable, its not performant, it not worth buying for Mac.
",1
"
So I bought into the hype. Extremely disappointed. The ""ergonomic"" arch is weird and is a bit too large. Because the arch slopes, the finger on left button will be angled, not in a straight position. The click sound is too clicky. Mouse is too large to comfortably move around. Being precise in pointing with this will take some getting used to. Overall feeling is that I should have bought something else.

"
I have been skeptical about spending so much money in such an item like this.100 bucks for a mouse!But you really get what you pay for. The quality and the hot keys the mouse comes with are really really appealing.

I work across multiple computers and monitors, the Bluetooth connectivity and new SetPoint module with the new FLOW software allow me to work across 3 computers without having to push switches or buttons. Yes there is an option to work it that way, but FLOW in OPTIONS software is AWESOME. YOU NEED THIS MOUSE.

 Using MX 3 Master (without ""S"") with no issues and like itBut this one have a very laud scroll sound. Hate using it ;(
",2
"
It's way too big for smaller hands.  I can barely reach the middle scroll wheel and can't reach the little bonus button on the flat side.  I had wrist pain within 5 minutes.  Come on logitech, I'd like a nice mouse too!  I'm a 5'5 woman by the way.
",4
"
Might be a little large for some grips. Not really meant for gaming, haven't tried it for that. Logitech Options software very good for customization.Nitpick: the button on the side thumb flat area is a little hard to actuate, but that may be my own personal ergonomics. I wouldn't mind if there were one more thumb-accessible button, maybe inside the horizontal scroll wheel, but that's not a big deal.
",5
"
I lost my MX Master 2, so I gave version 3 a try. It keeps all of the good features while improving some annoyances!- Having a separate row for the fwd/back keys is nice. (I configure one of them to act as middle-click.)- The scrolling is even smoother.- USB-C 😍- Given that I have big hands, I was concerned about the shape change. I got used to it very quickly.
",5
"
This mouse is great. It's comfortable, ergonomic, and high quality. It's huge, so if you have small hands it may not be for you. The software for device switching is easy to use and seemless. Very satisfied.
",5
"
The MagSpeed scroll wheel works great! It's great when you're scrolling through lines of code. Bought this with the MX Keys as a bundle and they work well together. Could've been great if they included the palm rest when buying the bundle though
",4
"
The idea of scrolling past hundred of lines (~1000!) per second is very appealing, especially for long pages of code. I liked being able to switch between 2 modes, ratchet and free wheel. The free wheel mode is mostly okay but is it is not nearly as fast as it promised to be. It is much faster than a regular mouse but at the same time it takes some practice to be able to stop the wheel momentum and aim at the right spot. The rachet mode, on the other hand, is a mess. This is what should resemble the most a regular mouse.  Unlike a normal mouse, the scrolling motion on screen somehow stops before the wheel stops rolling,. You can literally see the wheel keep rolling and the screen stays motionless. To me this was unacceptable, especially for such an expensive mouse. The freewheel mode is almost completely silent, but when you stop the motion to stop a given spot on a long page it makes loud ""thunk"" noise which at the beginning is satisfying but in the long run feels like a gimmick and becomes annoying.

Love these mice, been a fan of the MX mice for a long time, it points, it clicks, charge lasts forever and it’s USB-C, all very good things.Logitech’s ergonomic peripherals are always great in quality, comfort and even price. The addition of useful functions like gestures, programmable buttons, the horizontal scroll wheel and more make this the best version of the mouse I’ve ever had. Highly recommended.

I liked it the first time out of the box. Even the box is cool. For shooter games it's extremely accurate.

My pet cobra still has not digested this mouse. It is very durable! It is a heavy mouse, so my cobra has been a bit slower since consuming it.

Best mouse I've used, hands-down.

"
As far as I can tell, the main difference between the MX3 and the MX2s is the scroll wheel. While the machined steel feels much nicer, there's some sort of issue that causes the scroll to momentarily lag on my MacBook, making it unresponsive and frustrating to use.This tradeoff isn't worth the $40 price increase over the MX2s. I returned this and bought the previous generation.
",3
"
Logitech nailed this mouse - the best for serious users.  Other high end mice haven't made the bar (tried dozens) and this one finally dethroned my 10 year old logitech MX.  I hope this newer mouse lasts as long!
",5
"
I had to exchange this for the Logi MX Master 3 for MAC.  That said, I have been extremely impressed with the mouse and how much time it saves.  This mouse is near perfect and comfortable with extended use.  I think it is a great value at $99.00.
",5
"
I upgraded from an MX mouse which I loved but I was charging it at least once per week. This one has lasted me nearly two months so far and I have not charged it; incredible. My only problem with it is the horizontal scroll does not have the 'indents' that the vertical scroll has; the horizontal is always free-scrolling. Otherwise, it's the perfect mouse for my office job.

Excellent update to the original MX Master.  Gentle contours, excellent battery life, 3 different systems that it can be paired with, and overall a hugely pleasant experience for a business/creative oriented mouse.  Highly recommend.

This mouse is a productivity beast. All the buttons are in just the right spot for someone with rather large hands, it's got a great feel, and having type-c charging was the icing on top! I can't believe I waited so long to buy one.

Mouse is awesome but the fact that you have to create a Logitech account is just one more password I have to track. And during the installation it re-booted my machine w/o first notifying me and killed my VPN connection so I'm scrambling to save files to my HD. I am so sick of tech companies making you jump thought hoops and providing personal information before you use the product you just purchased. Made what should have been a painless process very painful. C'mon Logitech.......

Plug and play with optional presets for popular apps. Overall great mouse and super comfortable to use for hours.

I bought this to use on my work PC. It turns out that without the software it performs as a $10 mouse. My co. has denied the Options+ software, (5000+ employees) for 'security reasons' since logitech piggybacks lots of data tracking into the software. Knowing this I no longer buy anything logitech whether for work or personal.

"
Out of the box, this was clearly the nicest mouse I have used. Great feel in the hand and wonderful functionality. Once I had it set up I discovered all sorts of features I hadn't known of, such as Flow (that lets me use it on two adjacent laptops, just passing from screen to screen).If it holds up, I would happily recommend or buy another when I wear this out.
",5
"
This mouse has so much potential to be great. The form factor, battery life, and feature (on paper) are all great, but I don't think I've ever had this much trouble with a wireless mouse. As many others have pointed out, scrolling is a pretty inconsistent mess, and horizontal scrolling even more so. It is extremely comfortable to use for the design work I do, but every now and then, the mouse will become unresponsive, and I have to power cycle it.If it weren't for these connectivity and scrolling issues, this would be a perfect mouse for me, but these are huge factors that are holding it back, especially for the price point.

Very nice but sometimes it stops working for a minute, then it starts again. You would think a mouse that cost so much would work all the time!

I have a fairly small hand and I found the mouse was a bit too big for me.  I also don't like how they rubberize their mice.  I find my hand gets a bit hot and sticky.  I wish they were all hard, cool plastic.

I really want to like this mouse because it feels so good in my hand, but after a few months of use at my home computer (2020 MacBook Air) I'm still not as comfortable with it as my Apple Magic Mouse at work (2018 iMac). The MX Master 3 has more advanced button customization that I still haven't taken advantage of, but the Magic Mouse just seems more intuitive to use. I'll give it more time but this become a ""simpler is better"" conclusion.

My MX Master is still working fine. I just wanted to test these new ones and they are amazing.The scroll feels a little weird at first but you'll get used to it. It's a little slimmer and lighter compared to MX Master 1, which makes it more ergonomic and comfortable.

I've had many, many of the high end Logitech mice throughout the years, and I can definitely say this is the nicest one yet. Ergonomically it's fantastic, and although all the other Logitechs I've had were great as far as build quality, but this one feels like a step up. Everything just feels so smooth and precise. Definitely a must have if you're working on a computer 8 hours a day.

I was nice for one year. It start to stop when I move it. I pay more than one hundred dollars and now I am getting another. I won’t buy some  like this again.Don’t waist your money.

You would expect a mouse this expensive to not have scrolling inconsistencies. Especially noticeable after rapid change in scrolling direction. This was pointed out by many reviewers before but you'll understand how big of an issue this is once you actually try it. My old $10 mouse has a better scrolling.
",1
"
I have used the MX master 3 before and liked it so much I bought a second one for work. The mouse that I received has a strange issue with the scroll wheel that is very annoying. It has a ""bounce"" or ""reverb"" inside of it when scrolling on the click scroll setting. When scrolling at a medium speed, it will make a fairly loud bouncing noise and will vibrate in your hand. I believe this to be a manufactures defect as this bounce is not present in my other mouse.This mouse has amazing functionality for productivity but I would not recommend it for gaming.

I was using the Mac Mouse for years and continued to be frustrated with recurring issues. I finally broke down and moved out of the Apple ecosystem and tried the MX Master 3. My only complaint- I didn’t switch years ago!

I upgraded from the MX Master 2 and I don’t regret it!!! I love it so far especially the super fast scroll wheel !!! On the flip side its not worth the $99 price tag unless you really need a new mouse.

"
Lack of replacement parts and a scroll wheel that breaks if you ever drop the mouse off your desk. (Being wireless that is likely to happen.) A low polling rate for the price.While this mouse is comfortable it misses in to many places. If Logitech actually supported the product then it would be great... Sadly they dont. Not only that but when you consider the price and the environmental concerns this is just future e-waste... Non reparable products are just unacceptable in these times.

The best mouse I have very used for productivity. Can't say the $100 price tag is justified though. But after using the magspeed scroll wheel, I can't go back to a regular one.

I purchased the MX Keyboard first, loved it, then decided to get the mouse.  These two work seamlessly on up to three devices.  LOVE the super scroll, love the ease of clicking.  Fantastic all the way around!

I had an MX Master 2S and based on reviewed debated whether the upgrade to 3 was worth it. It totally is. Not only is it slightly more responsive, the back/forward buttons are in a much better place, and side scroll wheel is much better (larger and smoother), and the main scroll wheel is awesome now. Also the software for the 3 is much more advanced and customizable.

This mouse is top of the line for improving your overall workflow. I would not suggest this mouse strictly for gaming, though it works.

I loved it at the beginning but after a few months, the scroll stopped working properly. It is like the scroll is not clicking anymore and it is scrolling randomly. When you move the mouse the scroll is moving without being touched and there is also no way that you can scroll small up or down.Odd enough, the scroll problem showed after a few months but it again started working properly for a while and it stopped again. This is so annoying.

I had the mx master 2s, apart from the noisy scroll that mouse was perfect. When this one came out I sold my 2s and bought it. This was in October, now in February there is a VERY noticeable deformation in the rubber that has started to fall through a hole in the plastic. It feels wrong and catches my thumb every time. I wonder how does Logitech test its products if they allowed such a poor design choice to get approved. I had no such problems with the previous gen. My use case is simple office use, although I do use all the buttons the mouse provides for shortcuts.Apart from the physical flaw, the thumb button is harder to use compared to the previous gen, and when you use the lateral scroll your thumb will always brush against the two small buttons beneath it, lately I've also noticed the scroll wheel skip some lines periodically, but you get used to these things.

It’s been a month and half and the right click already does not work for me.I had the Logitech M570 trackball which worked great for me and I really miss that now.The right click of this mouse also stopped working properly but after three years, but I did not expect the right click of my new mouse would stop functioning properly after a month and half.I passed the return period so it’s a shame I have to buy another one. But definitely not going to buy another Logitech.

I want this mouse to be everything it promises to be. However, the back and forward buttons don't do anything on my mac. To solve this, I downloaded Logitech's control center software. The software gives no help on pairing the device. I have my mouse paired to my computer AND plugged in with the USB dongle. Still, the software says it's unable to find any Logitech devices. It's pretty bad when their own software can't even recognize their own devices. Naturally, Logitech's documentation online is abysmal, and so far after an hour of research, my buttons still don't work! For such an expensive mouse, this is a really terrible user experience. I will consider returning this item if I can't get this working like I want.

This mouse is nice looking, rechargeable, accurate and ergonomic.The scroller is made from what looks to be aluminum. It is difficult to scroll a small amount (there are no minimum clicks).The main buttons are super super loud. I have a secondary silent mouse that I use at night, or when I am annoying myself and others with the loud snapping click of the mouse.The other buttons are nicely placed.Not sure what the reason behind the intentionally loud click is for?

I like the mouse but a Windows 10 update invalidated the bluetooth connection and it proved impossible to get it back. Had to use the unifying connection instead.

Feels much more comfortable than a usual mouse.  The quick scroll is great, but I haven’t used many of the other features, which I have found to be either unintuitive or unnecessary.  My office paid for it, and I’m not sure I would have justified the price myself.

For the money its worth it, a little on the pricey side but If you are into high end peripherals this is for you.

Super ergonomic mouse.If you have big hands like me and work in the computer all day and/or design like me this is a great purchase

This would be a 5 star review as I love the mouse.  I have an issue though where when I place my finger on the scroll wheel it clicks.  Whenever I actually press the scroll wheel for middle click it clicks twice.  This does not affect performance of the mouse itself but I paid a premium for it because I wanted better quality and it should not be happening.  Logitech support will not help me and after sending them a video with the click being clearly audible they told me they don't see a problem, and I cannot crack it open to see whats going on inside as that will void the warranty.  Hopefully if you purchase this thing you will have better luck than I did but if you have to deal with Logitech support, well I wish you the best.

An absolute joy to use. Wireless performs flawlessly. Keybindings are excellent. Mouse has kept charge for 4 days under gaming sessions & research applications. Exceptionally comfortable while using palm OR claw grip. Both scroll wheels are the best i've touched so far. Worth every penny , and better than most high end gaming mice costing twice as much.

Product is not ergonomic at all! Just a couple of hours of use will cause your wrist to hurt. Also, is it small, so you will need to hold it in a way that you right side of the palm will be constantly in friction will you desk generating irritation.For this price I would have liked a true ergonomic mouse, even the 20usd “shark fin” mice are better at it

The Logitech MX Master 3 has received a lot of praise for its features, design and functionality. Having actually used it for several months, I can say that the value I've received does not match up to the price.The SmartShift feature which automatically shifts the scroll wheel from a ratchet mechanism to a free-spinning mode isn't useful at all. In fact, it was annoying enough for me to disable it. I chose to manually shift between the modes with a button on top the device. Then the button stopped working and I was stuck with only one mode.Aside from the free-spinning scroll wheel, the other features were mostly unused by me. The side scroll wheel is mostly useless and sometimes annoying when you accidentally touch it. I sometimes use the back button when browsing websites.I had high hopes for this device, but was ultimately let down. I can't recommend the Logitech MX Master 3 and probably won't pick up another Logitech device.Pros:* The free-spinning scroll wheel is nice* Rechargeable battery with long life* Ergonomic design* Wireless connectivity is goodCons:* Expensive* SmartShift is a useless gimmick* Sometimes malfunctions* Manual scroll wheel mode shift button stopped working after only a few months of use

Excellent product, at first it was a bit strange since they moved the side buttons and the scroll wheel, but after you get used to it, it actually feels like they are in better locations anyways. Works like if not better than the 2. Highly recommended.
",5
"
Awesome mouse!  Scrolls super fast and battery seems to last forever between charges.
",5
"
Bought this because of all the scrolling features it has. But scrolling is broken on some important Chrome webpages. It just stops and won't scroll again until a click happens somewhere on the page. The software for this needs an update. Other than that one important thing I need to work right it's a great mouse.Also needs a coast adjustment setting for smooth scrolling. It coasts way too far. Am chasing links with my pointer as they scroll up my screen for 4 seconds after I stop rolling the wheel.

Bought this because I have a personal computer which is a Mac and my work computer is a PC. The ergonomics is great, fits in your hand like a glove and the custom settings And shortcuts for both machines are amazing. Highly recommend

Charges rapidly, ready for use in 10 minutes.  No need for a USB Hub, Bluetooth works perfectly.  Options software allow you to adjust settings.  Button position on version three is more practical and appropriate to use.  Scroll wheel rocks.
",5
"
Overall, the mouse seems to work great. The one thing I do not like is the weight. It feels too light and cheap. Using it on my Mac has not been the best experience with the cursor acceleration as well as the scroll acceleration. Connecting it to my pc next week and will revisit if anything changes.

Really great mouse/keyboard combo for developers, lots of customization. I removed the auto scroll features because they were jaggy, responds nicely now

A little big but battery lasts a long time and is comfortable.

Software is great, cool design, durability is solid, button placement is good. However, the ""ergonomic"" structure hurt my hand for a week after just a day of use. The issue is that the ""hump"" (the peak height of the mouse) is so far to the rear and at such a steep incline. Your wrist MUST be an inch or more above the mouse surface, otherwise your wrist will feel very uncomfortable and quickly painful. That's a fail, which is a shame because it's otherwise perfect. So if you are one who likes to rest your wrist, look elsewhere.

Never thought I'd spend this much on a mouse, but this is pretty awesome. Worked out of the box with Bluetooth on my Arch machine and has been running for a month + without a charge. Great for navigating long source code files.

I'll start by saying I absolutely love the feel of this mouse and the ideas behind it. The customization is awesome. However, and it's a HUGE however, when I went to play Cyberpunk 2077 (basically the reason I chose this time to upgrade my mouse) the extra buttons do not register AT ALL! Even the middle mouse button does not register! Now you're thinking, well just assign them keystrokes. I thought the same... that doesn't work either. I am so, so disappointed that I can't use this wonderful looking/feeling mouse for what I intended. I've searched all over forums and don't see any fixes for this.

Unfortunately this mouse caused a lot of pain to develop in my wrist. It's not very ergonomic. It pushes your wrist upward instead of letting your wrist lay more flat and natural. Anyway, the mouse looks cool and is smooth, but wasn't worth the new pain.

I used this product for general office use. I travel with my laptop quite a bit so I wanted a mouse that could stand up to frequent travel. This mouse has a heavy feel and a nice touch, so I was happy to use it.That all stopped in May when the mouse started working only intermittently. Drivers updated and googling for answers was fruitless. I ended up having to buy a 2nd mouse.I'd save your money and look elsewhere. At this pricepoint I expect better durability.

It turns out that the wheel locks when the mouse is powered off and will spin freely once it's turned on. So keep that in mind. This mouse is awesome though - ergonomic and sturdy. Lots of customization options and great for productivity. Highly recommend.

I bought this to use with my macbook pro and air. The swipe gestures work intermittently no matter what you try. I tried setting up key bindings to switch desktops, but it only works 20% of the time. I ended up returning this item. Not worth it if it's for a Mac.

BEWARE: If you work for a large company that has software download restrictions, this mouse is not worth buying. For any of the additional features to work (anything more than a normal mouse, including the horizontal scroll wheel) you need to have the Logitech Options app installed on the computer. Since most large firms do not allow downloading 3rd party software, this mouse is not worth more than the $10-20 you would spend buying a cheap bluetooth mouse.I confirmed with Logitech Customer Support that there is no work around for this. You can not use another computer to set up the mouse settings and then use the mouse on the work laptop, the Logitech Options App MUST be installed for the extra mouse buttons and scroll wheel to work. I also confirmed that this is true for all previous versions of the MX mouse.

It is constantly connecting to the wrong laptop.  When it works right, it's great and convenient because I can copy and paste, for example, from one laptop to the other.

Let me get this straight, this is my second set of MX Master 3 mouse, so I know what I'm talking about. The first one lasted about 1-2 years and then the mouse's bottom sensor just wouldn't do the job. your mouse arrow will just go completely crazy on your screen, there is no ""recalibrate"" option from the program and it was way past the return date, so I smashed it after it ruined an important project. I decided to give it a second shot since I like the shape/feel of it, but guess what, this one's response is even worse, the sensor went off after one week and I keep having trouble on the lagging/ responding of the mouse. I tested my girlfriend's 12 bucks mouse from staples on the same computer and don't have any problem...... Now it's past the return date again and I'm stuck with it!

This mouse has been used very lightly. It will no longer scroll without lock up. The MX keys also failed. Contacted Logitech and it took them a month to call me and tell me they could send me a new mouse but not the keyboard as it only has a 1 year warranty.  Stay away from this company!

I have had three of these mice (two older versions and this one) all of them have serious lag issues that just sort of happen for no reason. Both in the receiver and Bluetooth. It's so infuriating. They're expensive mice, but I 100% urge you to look elsewhere. I've tried all the forums and no one really has an answer. Not even Logitech. It seems they blame who ever built your computer and the computer manufactures blame Logitech.If your mouse suffers from stuttering or  lag... it may go away, but it will always come back. It's so bad I can't even do my job, so I had to go back to a $10 mouse. At least that actually works. Trust me - you're better off looking somewhere else, unless you want to play the stutter game with Logitech.

The hype is real!

-It might be ergonomic but it doesnt feel like it.-I know its more recommended for ppl that actually do work like editing, excel sheets or w/e but with such good reviews I thought I'd give it a try as a daily gaming mouse but it doesn't really work for me.-I mainly bought it because of carpal tunnel issues but even then It still drags my wrist and pinky (still get pain from carpal tunnel)

Just the shoddiest mouse I've ever bought. The M1 Macs don't recognize it as a mouse for the purposes of disabling the trackpad, and the edges of the feet catch on things all the time. The scroll wheel behavior is awful - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's painfully slow. Doesn't matter if I swap to the USB receiver or use it on Windows instead.Probably the most disappointing mouse I've owned in 25 years of PC peripheral use.

I came to this from the original MX Mouse - which was still going strong, but my son dropped it and the back/forward buttons got jammed. I've had the original one since 2013 and it just refused to die of natural causes. :-)So when it broke I was actually excited to 'upgrade'.Bad move!Two reasons:a) Getting worse carpal tunnel symptoms with this mouse - the ergonomics are just not the same as the original mouseb) The metal in the mouse makes a super annoying sound whenever I click.I'll be using a Microsoft Keyboard/Mouse combo instead - with their ergonomic mouse. I use that at work already - but like to keep things different to avoid repetitive injury issues. Oh well, maybe the next iteration will be better.Unfortunately I have thrown away all the packaging otherwise would have returned the mouse. Will have to recycle. Same goes for the MXKeys keyboard too - it just sounds annoying with every key I type.

This mouse is a complete failure and a regret every penny I paid for it.First, it has been advertised as the ""ergonomic"" mouse, and I started getting sharp pain on me hand ""between my thumb and index"" and next to my litter finger. I have been using the magic mouse 2 for three years and half and I never ever had similar pain until I got this ""ergonomic"".Secondly **most importantly** the scrolling on this mouse is an utter disaster. The scrolling is not accurate, and in many times, you will have to scroll again as it does not pick it up every time.I came from  magic mouse 2 and I thought the grass was greener. TO BE RETURNED

"
- The Flow feature that is supposed to let you move between two Macs does not work nearly well enough to be functional.- The thumb gesture button is very hard and unnatural to engage; gestures are supposed to be light, while this is the hardest button of all to push on the mouse.- Otherwise, a functional mouse.

I was excited about this mouse, but ultimately let down once I unpackaged it. First of all, the seamless transition between computers is only seamless if you don't mind flipping the mouse upside down to push the button, which I do mind. Secondly, the software installation was confusing - it had me signing up for accounts online, plugging and unplugging devices; in the end, I couldn't get the software to work. I unloaded everything, removed my online account (like I need more junk email), repackaged this piece of junk, and sent it back. Disappointing, Logitech.

It fits your hand if you really move your hand forward. The biggest problem I have is the buttons are loud, sound cheap, and ridiculously sensitive. You can not let your fingers rest, even feather light wise. Previous series were better. Thumb wheel is a nice idea, but doesn't seamlessly work with all applications.Might need to return it.

Unpolished, unrefined edges on the top scroll wheel. It has an all metal design that scratches your fingers. Definite step down from the original MX Master mouse in terms of usability, as it had polished edges and a rubberized center for comfort.

I have used a Logitech performance mx for about 10 years, and there is wear on the buttons and where the thumb rests. This is expected for 10 years of use. However, when I got the mx master 3s 3 weeks ago, I'm starting to see wear on the left button already. I don't see this lasting more than 1-3 years of daily use.

"
This was a great mouse when I first received it. After only 7 months, the mouse now registers phantom clicks when I’ve only clicked once. I’ve tried cleaning it and every troubleshooting step Logitech recommends to no avail. What makes matters worse is that their online warranty claim sends you right back to the instruction manual which is useless. Now I have to try and find time to call their customer service line.

This mouse is great, except the scroll wheel doesn't work occasionally.  It's frustrating to have to stop and bang the thing to get the wheel to start working again.  Otherwise, it's the best mouse on the market!

on paper it looks goodm but didn't fit my needsi can't stand how the lower polling rate feels, it just feels choppy coming from a 1000hz wired mouseheavy, and just feels clunky to me. Im used to lower sensitivity so i lift my hand a lot while mousing around, and this was awkward for meit does feel good, and well built. love the metal scroll wheels but the thumb one feels gimicky. if i need to pan around excel/cad i usually just use the scroll drag. really wanted to like this mouse but just not for me

The Options+ software doesn’t work on corporate managed computers, so you can’t map the buttons (a key feature of the mouse) to anything you want.

Logitech is too smart for their own good it seems. The unifying software is glitchy and there are two different kinds of dongle. If the MX MASTER worked well consistently it would be awesome, but I have purchased and returned TWO. poor connectivity and wonky highlighting due to poor connectivity.

This Mouse is built well and ergonomic were needed. If you are planning to buy this for your M1 Macbook however I would not recommend this and advise you to look elsewhere. The mouse is very laggy and and the scroll wheel is a chore to use. Even after fully charging and putting on the given dongle it did not solve the issue. I tried the mouse with my PC which works great however that wasn't what I needed this for. Also this mouse is NOT for gaming.

The Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse - Graphite is a well constructed mouse, but the most important feature of the Options Software is not present (there is no pointer acceleration setting).  The only way to get accurate pointer motion is to lower the pointer speed, but this will result in having to move the mouse 6 inches left or right for a dual monitor setup.  Also the Options Software disables SetPoint which has an acceleration setting.

This mouse stutters across the screen, causing some kind of weird screen redraw on my Mac. Sometimes it times out and doesn't respond mid scroll. It was so frustrating and killed my productivity.

I bought mine off the Logitech website. They have a 25% off sale for the 12 days of Logi. So if you don't see verified buyer that's why.I wanted to love this mouse, but the one and only thing I do not like is that the buttons are way to easy to press. I accidentally click all the time. Its really annoying I can't rest my fingers on the button.That said I love that they are quiet buttons.Ergonomics for me are good. My hands are just barely big enough to palm a basketball if that gives you a point of reference for my point of view on ergonomics . I feel the the dedicated side buttons and the thumb wheel are in decent spots for me. I however find the ""gesture"" button on the flat part quite awkward to press and make a gesture. I use the top middle button as a gesture button to remedy this though.It has a led indicator of battery, however I can't figure out how to get it to light up.Other than that it's a great mouse that offers customization for a lot of apps.Logitech options softwarethis is the software that lets you customize the mouse functions for the buttons and scroll wheel.Word of warning it requests permission to access your accessibility and your ""input monitoring""I turned off the input monitoring, but kept on accessibility access. I think some of the custom functions rely on possibly a accessibility api from apple.I set it up for android studio and tried tab switching as one of the functions on the thumb scroll wheel and it pulled up a menu that you could scroll through to select the tab instead of shuffling through the tabs with out a menuOtherwise so far so good.

I have to change my previous review of this item due to not working as intended... in fact, it doesn't work at all.It started with random disconnections, then it stopped working wirelessly, I changed drivers, tested on a different computer with no effect, the only way it kept working was plugged to the included cable but after just a couple of weeks it stopped working altogether, not connecting ever again.I tried to contact Logitech support and it was awful, you will not get a complete refund unless you leave on the US... avoid like the plague

The scroll wheel doesn't register if you scroll too quickly. This results in a very awkward feeling experience. There is no way I could ever use this mouse for work / productivity. This is apparently a known problem. There is a lengthy reddit thread about it. The mx master 2 scroll wheel works fine but everyone seems to have problems with the mx 3, even people who have owned multiple mx3's. Pity because other than this it's a great overall mouse.

"
If you're a Mac user and are expecting the same seamless experience as older models, be forewarned. The firmware needs serious work as does the Logi Options software. It seems they've compromised on software quality and testing--the device is laggy when moving the mouse and the scroll customizations often stop working altogether. Reinstall of the app doesn't fix the issues either.

Sadly after all these years, the MX Revolution is still the best mouse ever made. I also appreciate the click button responsiveness of the Performance MX mouse. The MX Master series (1,2 and now 3) all have click buttons that are not springy/clicky/responsive (however you want to put it) enough. After about an hour of use, the click buttons become mushy, in that the don't travel and rebound well enough to make using it a snappy and enjoyable experience. Cheap parts? Inability to listen to customer feedback?  I don't know. I'm just disappointed. If anybody knows a workaround to make the click buttons more responsive, I'd love to hear it.

I'm Mac user and I bought this product having in mind the productivity benefits that are promised with this mouse. Unfortunately I didn't have a good usage experience. The mouse loses the capability to use Mac's gestures and this problem dissapears after a while without a apparent reason (I'm using bluetooth connection). It's very frustrating, specially when I have a lot of work and the gestures are gone...I'm totally dissapointed with this purchase and now I'm looking to get another product.

Several issues with this mouse.The main one being Unbalanced Scroll wheel on the MX Master 3. Terrible and inconsistent scrolling experience on both Mac and Windows, the wheel spins by itself due to the weight and build, this is very noticeable when laying it flat on the desk already but I thought this video could help illustrate how it feels when lifting it up as by design the wheel seems heavy and unbalanced.

This mouse is so so so good.

The only improvement for this mouse compared to MX 2s is the horizontal scroll wheel, which is bigger and positioned better. Everything else is a downgrade from MX 2s. The material is less comfortable. If you use Macbook Pro, the vertical scroll does not behave correctly. This is both hardware and software bugs with the new vertical wheel. Very disappointed. Consider MX 2s or Triathlon instead.

I bought one to replace my Logitech MX Master X2 and it had tracking issues. OK fine, I had Amazon replace it, no big deal but then the second one came and had the same issue. Ok let's test it with the MX S2. Literally going from one mouse to another side by side I can see a huge difference in performance. WTF? I even ordered the MX keys because I'm a Logitech Fanboy and I had to return that keyboard also because It wasn't working properly. I really love Logitech and want them to succeed but these new products suck.

This mouse has great ergonomics and it worked fine for a few months, then it became erratic in applications such as Chrome and Outlook. It is no longer usable for my work and it has wasted hours upon hours of fruitless troubleshooting. Logitech has never bothered to fix the firmware even though it is a common topic in Logitech user communities. Shame on you Logitech for charging $99 for an increasingly unusable product.

In order to switch over to another computer using this mouse you must turn the mouse over and press the corresponding number associated with the computer. The problem - I move between computers quickly. Because of this,  I am constantly turning the mouse over and it requires 2 hands. This creates a lot of wasted time. I cannot imagine why Logitech would not place the change button on top. I no longer use the mouse. Expensive lesson for me. Frustrating.

I purchased this mouse for a number of reasons.... but the deciding factor was the horizontal scroll wheel on the thumb.  Unfortunately this intermittently works 50% of the time.  Opening the logitech app will often get it working again but it's extremely frustrating and makes this mouse a nuisance more than a productivity enhancer.

Why buy a mouse with multiple functions? To make your life easier when working with it. NOT with this mouse. Forget about using this with a MAC. Every extra button will fail you aside from the regular 1 and 2 click buttons. Buy a $10 mouse for that. The software with Apple OS will drive you F'ing insane. So don't waste your cash. No support. No refund by the time it screws you over. Do not waste your cash on this for its extra features. Period. Used to be a Logi guy, no longer.

I currently have a Logitech Performance MX mouse that I have used for nine years. Unfortunately, the scrolling mechanism is malfunctioning. I decided to buy the ""MX Master 3"" version thinking the physical form would be identical or very similar. Unfortunately, I have quickly found that this mouse -- for me -- is unusable. There is a steeper ""round off"" such that my ring finger and pinky are forced into an unnatural position. Within 5 minutes my hand began cramping noticeably. Obviously, your experience may be different. But for me, I am disappointed this experience did not work out.

The side scroller does not work consistently when mapped to scroll horizontally within apps even when configured through the Logitech Options tool. This makes a key defining feature on an expensive mouse largely useless. Equally as useless is Logitech support as they will have you troubleshoot the mouse over and over before offering to replace the unit. Logitech needs to fix the actual problem and make the feature work consistently and reliably. The company still makes great mice but this is not one of them. Avoid and go with something less gimmicky.

I was sent a used MX Master 2S in a MX Master 3 box before I returned it to get the MX Master 3 I ordered. Turns out they added macro buttons to the new model to go back and forth through web pages.

This particular mouse is terribly designed with poor ergonomics. Everything good about the 2S was ruined in this design.

After just 20 minutes of use, the side buttons started malfunctioning. Any action you assign to the side buttons, are doubled. No matter if you jus let press once.

(Bought with my desktop but I leave my reviews on AMZN where I do most of my shopping.)They say this is the top productivity mouse, and that seems close to true.  There are three main reasons:1.  The side wheel is awesome -- though not quite as useful as I expected.  I wonder if I should go back to a side tilt scroll wheel.2.  Customization per app is awesome to have.  However, the software is not as good as it should be, and it is hard to copy profiles from one to another.  E.g. why would anyone want different settings for Chrome vs Firefox vs Edge etc.?3.  Gesture button is innovative and super helpful.  When you get used to them, gestures turn any mouse button into 5!  That's really great for those of us who want more customization.  For example, on Chrome I use these 4 of these gestures on one buttons for closest tab, reopen tab, new tab, and refresh.  Super useful.  (Don't forget forward and back page, as well as forward and back tab, are already there own buttons/scrolls!  What CAN'T you control???)  That said, as a power user, I would still appreciate even more buttons.  I am not sure why they dont add at least one button each for ring finger and pinky on the right, and perhaps an extra button at upper left.  These are all innovations Razer has put in, and I wish for here.Negatives:  While I do think this is probably the best productivity mouse currently on the market, it is still not perfect.  I take off 1 star for the following reasons (some already mentioned above):A.  Software is imperfect. Very hard to set everything up with full power, because there's no way to copy profiles or edit the mappings in a text document.  Very frustrating to then try to copy (for example) my four gesture buttons from Chrome to the other three browsers I use.  And BTW, some of the defaults are wrong -- e.g. right scroll on Excel is scrolling the thumbwheel LEFT (WHAT???).B.  Not enough buttons.  Why not give us more right hand buttons and upper left?C.  Flow doesn't work well.  I spent weeks trying to setup my machines.  Google for it and you'll see many people proposing all kinds of strange solutions for getting things past firewalls, etc.  And on top of that the customer service is terrible -- they couldn't figure it out and didn't respond to my for weeks, while I figured it out myself.  Should be easier for them to figure out their own software.That's it for now.  Stay tuned and I will soon be posting review also for MX Keys Mini, Litra Glow, etc.  Foreshadowing:  they won't be as good as this one!!!

Giving 1 star because I received a used mouse. There is a scratch on the body top and signs of use at the bottom (see pictures). I don't know if this is Amazon's or Logitech's fault, but this is unacceptable.

so let me say i just received the MX master 3s as a birthday gift on 08/20/22: so far the device is great very ergonomic and feels great in the hand. the customization is great and the scroll wheel is as smooth as other reviews say it is. However when i first used the mouse it was having a lagging issue with my monitor which i found strange because on my 13in macbook pro it was fine. so after doing some research i discovered that the USB receiver loves USB 2.0 and not 3.0 and that seems to have mitigated the issue so far. hopefully i can update this later with a complete review but so far so good just that little hiccup

I actually like the shape of this mouse, but the metal scroll wheel can have tiny shards and is not comfortable to scroll.

I have used every premium mouse this company has made since the optical, cordless mouseman. Best mouse in the industry. However, it's hobbled with poor software. Options + is moving things in the right direction. It's already far better than Setpoint, LCC and Options and shows promise to eliminate the software deficiencies. People should know that if you have a problem, the support and warranty function from Logi is a one star experience. It's criminal leaving all but the tenacious simply burned. Love the mouse but I feel like I'm doing business with El Diablo frankly.

I've been using Logitech mice for years. I used to have a MX Master 2 and it worked well. After I've bought my first Macbook Pro, I decided to get the Magic Mouse and while it worked well with the Macbook, it doesn't feel as substantial to hold as the Logitech MX Master 2. Granted, the Magic Mouse was meant more of a touch surface device. You also can't customize the Magic mouse like you can with Logitech. Therefore I've decided to get this MX Master 3s. And it's great. Works right out of the box and now I'm able to have customized buttons to make work more efficient. I do a lot of copy of pasting and being able to do that with a click of a button is great. You can also customize the side scroll wheel to jump between browser tabs. The mouse is able to be used on various surfaces, even without a mouse pad. I'm very happy with this purchase.

I've been using Logitech Mx Master Mouses for years.  I started off with the original MX Master, then the MX Master 2S.  Not mush difference between the first two.  The MX Master 3 however is different, it trumps the first two by a wide margin.  It is quieter, the buttons are easier to access (I do Program them) and it moves around easier.  I use a SteelSeries mouse pad and the marriage of that pad with the Logitech mouse is perfect.  It fits my hand as well as the earlier models.

Logitech’s MX Master line of mice has become a gold standard for office mice. This year’s edition of the series brings improvements, albeit iterative, over the previous generation. The MX Master 3 is responsive and precise enough to negotiate sophisticated business and creative tasks even when placed on glass desktops. Unfortunately, gamers that are into high FPS shooter genres still may not get the responsiveness they desire from the MX Master 3.There’s a ton to like about this mouse starting with the ergonomics. If you’re right-handed (sorry fellow lefties) this mouse was designed to provide a rich feature-set at your fingertips. The revamped electromagnetic scroll wheel might be the most lauded feature due to the stunning silence with which it operates. There are also gesture controls, a second scroll wheel and and dedicated forward and back buttons nestled within thumb’s reach.Connectivity and battery life are amazing on the MX Master 3. The MX Master 3 can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. There are even edge controls where dragging and dropping files from on synced, open systems is as simple as dragging the mouse to the corner of the screen. Then there’s the issue of battery life. I charged this mouse once (and gladly did so via USB-C) and it’s run strong on 3 different systems for over a month. Logitech claims a 70-day battery life and they may not have been exaggerating. I wish I could tell for sure how much battery life is remaining, but there are no battery indicators so far as I can tell.Pros:- Beautifully designed mouse with a robust feature-set and cross-OS useability- Superb battery life. Day 33 and this mouse is still going strong. I also appreciate having USB-C charging. Manufacturers need to universally adopt USB-C as the standard for charging and syncing devices today.- Works on all types of surfaces from wood to glass with no issues.- Can connect via Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz adapter; useful for devices that may not have Bluetooth built-inCons:- Not designed for lefties. As a southpaw, I was bothered that this mouse makes no pretenses about being designed exclusively for right-handed customers. We lefties have to adapt to something that isn’t made for us.- Could be related to my being a lefty trying to adjust to a right-handed mouse but I kept inadvertently clicking the forward and back buttons on this mouse. Seems innocent, but if you’re typing a document within a web browser that content can/will be lost.- High FPS gamers may be left out in the cold with this mouse. At this price point, Logitech shouldn’t exclude any demographic who’d want to use their product.Overall, I think this is the finest general purpose mouse on the market. Users can go from business and productivity work to creative designs without issue. This mouse even works on multiple OS’s with quick access to file transfers for open systems even if they’re not using the same operating system. Lefties and gamers may lose some comfort and convenience, but I think all but the most ardent within these sub-groups will find a way to be perfectly satisfied with the MX Master 3 Mouse. Highly recommended to most users.

Love this mouse for the side scroll as I use excel a lot and for the ergonomic feel. However, after a full day of working the sweat from my hand deteriorates the soft plastic where your palm lays. Really gross, wouldn’t recommend.

The mouse has the worst Scroll Wheel in the history of scroll wheels.  Their $20 mouse is better than this.  Logitech will never get it right.

Lagging: 1. Turn off Windows Device Sleep mode. 2. Move 2.4 KHz modem as far as possible from mouse 3. Revive Response by holding mouse less than 6 inches from Dongle. Rear mounted Dongle was useless. Front panel mounted Dongle got best results. This trick works every time!!! Mouse gets a ""lock"" on the Dongle that lasts over an hour in most cases. Refresh takes less than 2 sec. Remember, Mother Nature doesn't care what you want, She has her own rules. Perhaps a Firmware upgrade will improve stability. I will add 5 KHz modem and disable 2.4 KHz to see if stability improves more. Have a Happy Day!

I've been mostly using gaming mice the last several years, even for normal work and Logitech is currently my favorite brand for lightweight, quality, and reliability. I've heard so many great things about the MX Master mouse and was curious to try it. I will say right off the bat that I was and am very impressed with this mouse. It is comfortable to use, extremely accurate, works on any surface including a glass desk, and the battery lasts about a month before needing a charge. Those features are great but the main thing that keeps me using this mouse over my other ones is the scroll wheel and the gesture feature which is programmable. The side scroll wheel is also very high quality and can be programmed on a per application basis which is just fantastic.For users of the previous MX Master, this has a lot of similar features but the most noticeable to me are the side buttons, which are laid out more like a traditional gaming mouse and not crammed on top of each other like the previous models. I actually tried using this for gaming and aside from being a bit heavy, it works very well. I wouldn't recommend this primarily as a gaming mouse but for someone who plays occasionally, this one works fine and there's no need to buy a separate mouse, although I would recommend a mouse pad for gaming.Aside from the build quality, the way it feels, and all the thoughtful features, I like the modern additions on this mouse. I have so many wireless mice and this is the only one with a USB-C port. No wireless charging on this model but due to the long battery life, it's really not needed. Just charge it once a month (they claim a battery life of 70 days but I have a reminder set to charge it at the end of each month to be consistent). If you do run the battery all the way down, one minute of charging will last 3 hours. Another interesting feature of this mouse is the ability to pair it to 3 different computers via Bluetooth by flipping a switch on the bottom and it works great on both OSX or Windows 10. I did not have a chance to test on Linux. I don't use the Bluetooth feature, I prefer to use the dongle. It's absolutely not needed if you use Bluetooth, but I prefer the dongle because it's just a bit faster and if you use this mouse for gaming at all, you will notice a difference in response time.If I had to list one reason why I'm giving this mouse 5 stars, it's the scroll wheel. It really is incredible and hard to explain in a review. You can go from scrolling one line or pixel at a time to flying down a long document. It's really incredible and by far the best feature of this mouse and the best scroll wheel I've ever used. If you are looking for a top productivity mouse for graphic design, coding/development, or just want a really nice mouse - this is the one I'm going to recommend. It's not cheap but you can really feel the quality as soon as you put your hand on it.

I bought this mouse from Best Buy, which apparently does not come with the adapter. It’s a beautiful and well crafted, feature full mouse. In the end I decided to return it due to the insane amount of input lag (in the magnitude of anywhere from 100-400ms)This wouldn’t have been so much of an issue if I could plug it in and use it without a wireless connection; After all, it is a decent mouse except for the very disappointing response times.I’ve tested with other wireless mice but none of them had this issue. After I returned it, I found out that a few of my coworkers also had the mouse, and the issue some of us had in common was the input lag.At this price range I absolutely expect better from logitech or any other company. 👎🏻

Been using the MX Master series since it started, and generally had very good luck. However, the middle-click on this one died within three months. That said, I'll probably get another and cross my fingers that this was a one-off issue with my mouse rather than in general. Otherwise, still love it.

I've almost elusively used ""gaming mice"" because good ones need to do a lot of things well to match the precision needed for some games, eve if I'm using it mostly for other things.I bought this when I started a new job for its ability to quickly switch between multiple devices; I can switch between my personal PC, work laptop, and iPad with the touch of a button. Granted, this button is on the bottom of the mouse, so you do need to lift it up and turn it over to press it. I'm not sure if that is an oversight, or intentional to avoid accidentally pressing the button. Either way, its still the fastest and easiest way that I know of to switch a mouse between devices. You can even configure it to control both computers at the same time with logitech's software, but I didn't find that as reliable.When I first got it I had issues with disconnects, where I'd have to unpair and re-pair the mouse to fix it. I made sure the firmware was updated and followed all Logitech's posted troubleshooting. So I was  slightly annoyed when I reached out to their support team  and in response just got a copy/paste of the support articles I told them I had already read. But it ended up being a non-issue, as the disconnect issue went away on its own , at least for now.The battery is outstanding. I use it basically all day every day, and have only had to charge it maybe 2 times since I got it in early February.Once in a while the mouse will lock up for a second or two. Its a minor annoyance 99% of the time, but it can be a serious deal-breaker in games like shooters. I still keep my wired Corsair mouse nearby for these types of games.The ergonomics are excellent. The thumb rest is great to keep your thumb from dragging on whatever surface you are on, and the thumb buttons are perfectly placed. Speaking of surfaces, tracking is excellent on every surface I've tried; it works about as well on my leg as it does on my mouse pad.But maybe the best thing about this mouse is the scroll wheel. It is, in a word, delightful. It has two modes controlled by the button in front of it. In one, there is basically no friction at all, the smoothest scrolling wheel I've ever used. Press the button, and now when you scroll slowly, there will be clicks to help you scroll in steps start scrolling faster, and the friction melts away. I frequently find myself spinning the wheel just to time how long it will go on until it stops (20 second record, beat that). The side scroll wheel doesn't have the same magic, and often doesn't seem to be supported. But it's still useful where it works.Overall, it's a great mouse. If you can only have one mouse and you play fast paced games, you should probably look elsewhere. Otherwise, you really can't go wrong, and if you have multiple devices you'd like to control, it's a no-brainer.

This mouse is great from every perspective, but on new M1 Mac, even after doing all the suggested troubleshooting, this mouse lags. Sometimes to the point I put it away and get out the cheap travel mouse because that experience is better than the lag. Forget gaming... writing an email sucks when the cursor lags.

I have been using this mouse for the past four days.  I was eager to test out this mouse because I love my Logitech keyboard (the G815), even though I was already using a precise gaming mouse (the Viper Razer).The MX Master 3 is wireless, but it needs to charge via a usb cable.  According to the info sheet included with the mouse, a 3 minute charge will keep the mouse running for a full day, and a day of charging will run the mouse for up to 70 days.  I charged it for 10 minutes before using it the first day, and have had it charging at night while we sleep the past two nights.  The mouse has been going strong and has not had any power issues.The mouse connects to the computer with a small usb receiver.  I put it in one of the front ports of the computer because it was easier than fully swapping the mice.  My Razer is still connected, but is tucked away beside the tower.Shape-wise, this is the most comfortable and hand-conforming mouse that I have had in my hand.  It is just a bit too large and high off of the mouse pad to be comfortable for my smaller hand to use for hours on end.  I am 5'3"" and wear women's small to medium gloves.  If you have larger hands, this will probably not be an issue for you.  A wrist pad would also help, but that won't work with my desk layout.The scroll wheel is very sensitive and I love it.  The movement is responsive and precise, just as precise as my Razer, but way more precise than a cheapo ball mouse or an inexpensive optic mouse.The mouse is very easy to install and set up.  I was using the mouse within minutes of charging it.  It is customizable with Logitech software.I will be switching back to my Razer, but only because it fits better in my little hands for long periods of use.  If they made a smaller version of this mouse for smaller handed people, I'd be all over it.

9/29/19 Update: This mouse doesn't scroll in Calendar on the Mac. I sent an email to an address that was on a separate piece of paper that said it would be sent directly to the marketing director. But I received a response obviously from an outsourced support person who didn't appear to read my email but sent a scripted response asking for information that I had already sent. Unfortunately, support appears to be a long and tedious process if there is any.------------------------------------------------------------------------While I liked the size and shape of the mouse that came with my iMac plus swiping across the top to switch desktops, etc I always had a problem with getting it to click left or right, at least half of the time it would do the opposite even when I consciously place my fingers correctly. I got to where I hated the Apple mouse. This one is a decent replacement as long as you install additional software that is required to be downloaded from Logitech website not the App Store.Button placement is great and of course separate so that I know when I click left or right.While there is no swipe pad you can, after installing the software and letting it access settings, customize all of the buttons and rollers on the mouse. So I use the roller on the side to switch desktops.It is huge in comparison to the Apple mouse but I do like the shape and feel in my hand. But there is one tiny button right under your thumb that is hard to press so I set it to a seldom used function like accessing the desktop list at the top of the screen.You can also use this with up to three computers and literally swipe between them or press a button on the bottom of the mouse to use it with a different computer which works really well.And, where Apple really failed, you can charge this while you use it!Overall, I like this mouse as a replacement for the Apple mouse.

Understand I am not a gamer, I use the mouse for work in industrial environments where the work surfaces are not always an ideal desktop.  That was the  main reason I choose this mouse to begin with.  It works fantastic on all sorts of surfaces including dusty, stainless, shiny, painted, pitted, etc.  I can go from clean quartz counter top to a nasty toolbox and this thing doesn't miss a beat.I had the 2S until it broke.  The left main button broke of in my laptop bag.  The reason it broke it because unlike most simple mice packages, the buttons on this mouse hang off the front of the unit.  This is the part that frustrates me.  If you simply throw it into a pocket in a laptop bag and it gets squished, it can break.  Ask me how I know.  So, when I bought the new MX 3, I also purchased a small digital camera case and I now put it in the case before I throw it in the laptop bag.The other, and more important reason I have a complaint with this otherwise fantastic mouse is this.  Since, as I mentioned, the buttons on the mouse hang over the front of the unit, if you are using the mouse and the front of the unit bumps into something, it clicks the mouse.  I have had numerous times where I bump into a coffee cup, a notebook, the front of my laptop, a monitor stand, etc. and the buttons get clicked.  Granted, I work in an area less than ideal, I get it, but I don't recall ever having this issue with any other mouse that I have owned.  Maybe someone from Logitech will see this and version 4 will be different!I still love it though...

So you’re aware, I exchanged for the original MX Master mouse.I didn’t like the overall feel of this mouse and it was lagging- even with all the updates and things it needed to operate. Poor idea for Gaming.So you need more than one Mice to game, work and daily home stuff.

I have had this mouse for about a year now.The brilliant: horizontal scroll and the regular scroll. I work with many large documents and medical ""images"" that I have to scroll through. Being able to basically scroll through without having to make that same repetitive motion helps save my fingers from becoming fatigued (it's also quite and quite satisfyingly smooth). The ""flow"" feature to switch between multiple monitors/computers with a single mouse is really brilliant. If you have a use case for it, you'll enjoy it and it's easier to set up than the software/network version I was using before.The good: it is sensitive and precise. It allows for subtle movements well and does not jump around. The battery life is perfectly adequate for my needs, I charge it every now and then when the light indicates. The size seems fine for me, not too large, not too small. I have slightly above average hand size for a man. Bluetooth set up is a breeze.The OK: the back and forward buttons are positioned a tad too high to be comfortably used. I have to tilt my whole hand up in order to reach. For someone using a mouse 10-12+ hours a day, those kind of movements are not comfortable.The not great: the button for the thumb rest platform is too small of a target and positioned too far back to easily click. It requires a kind of ""rolling"" maneuver to hit it with my thumb ""knuckle"". I essentially do not use any of the buttons on this mouse for these reasons. I also wish it had better mapping options.The unknown: I do not game so can't speak to its value for that. Its durability seems fine for the past year, but no idea if it holds up well going forward.Overall: 5/5 for me. It's too good at the things I really care about to knock it down to 4 stars. I enjoy using this and even if it lacked the buttons entirely, I'd still be very happy with this mouse, so I just pretend they aren't there. They don't get in the way and I never accidentally click them.

 I have to use a Windows PC for work but I also use my Mac for Reminders and other things. So, I always have both open. I had 2 keyboards and 2 mice and I would have to keep switching back and forth. It was confusing.  Got the MX Master 3 Mouse and MX Keyboard and Logitech Flow (included with the mouse) allows me to use the same keyboard and mouse seamlessly. I go to one edge of the screen and the mouse all of a sudden starts working on the other computer.  It's otherworldly. I can copy and paste text and files between the two. I know having to switch between your two bluetooth keyboards is first world problems, but this made my workflow SO much more efficient and I feel awesome every time the mouse switches to the other computer.Beyond that, the mouse is great. Very customizable, ergonomic, enough buttons and options to do just about anything.  I'm still blown away by the Flow software and it's functionality. It's been perfect. HIGHLY recommend for anyone working on a Mac and Windows machine and not enjoying their life.

There's so many 1 and 2 star reviews bashing this mouse for it's MacOS performance. Let me tell you my experience has been nothing but excellent.I have a 2020 MBP 16"" with THREE devices connected via Bluetooth in my workflow: My Keychron K2 keyboard, Sony WH-1000MX4 headphones, and this mouse. I have had ZERO Bluetooth issues. If anything, my mouse wakes up instantly while my keyboard takes seconds.I would recommend this mouse to anyone pursuing maximum productivity.

The wheel is fixed.  Last year, when my old Logitech Performance MX mouse gave up the ghost I purchased the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse and found the mouse wheel on it unusable, it would rock back and forth when letting go over it moving the web page or spreadsheet or word doc.. making using the mouse infuriating.  I thought it was defective only to learn (many phone calls, exchanged products) that it was a ‘feature’.  No thanks.When I received the MX Master 3 I was flooded with relief when I started using it and the smooth scrolling wheel (that did not move when let go of) was back.  I love this mouse.Installation.The Logitech Options app had a lot of problems when setting up the MX Master 3 mouse.  The screen would black out and lock up and starting about 10% of the time.  When trying to apply application specific profiles the application locked up.  I finally just got the basics set and left the application alone.Usage.I find the mouse wheel on the MX Master 3 to be one of the most useful and smooth of any mouse I’ve used.  Out of the box the mouse sensitivity was way off and had to muck about with the Logitech Options app to get that set to my satisfaction.The forward and back buttons by the thumb are just not right yet.  They feel too small and in the wrong location, like they should be further forward.  My thumb seems to always rest on the forward and I would prefer it rest on the back or in the middle, but the mouse button layout is not designed out for that to be natural.  I find the thumb wheel to be really useful when I remember it exists.  Like switching tabs with it in a web browser.I have large hands.  The mouse feels different than my old Performance MX mouse (even though they look the same) but still feels comfortable for me.Overall exceedingly pleased with the MX Master 3 mouse.

Admittedly it took me a few work days to get used to this mouse as previously I've been accustomed to slimmer, more svelte devices. First impression was that this was a very chunky mouse. It sits wide and tall and and sort of embraces the entirety of your hand to use properly. That said, once you get used to it the cradling sensation becomes natural and comfortable and soon enough you'll be acclimated to it and will then marvel at its range of functionality and customization that really takes this one to the next level.For starters battery life is exceptional (USB-C charging) and when in a pinch you can fast charge this for a few minutes to get a full days use out of it. Tracking is amazing as well and in my work/leisure I use desktop/laptop setups in a wide range of environments and have typically lugged a mouse pad to insure usage on less than ideal surfaces. With this device - mouse pad is no longer necessary and have used it on surfaces ranging from chipped wood, coarse sheet metal and glass surfaces to great effect and proper precision. Customization is great provided that you install Logitech's device software and allows me to quickly and easily switch between 3 devices (my current setup = windows desktop, windows laptop, Macbook). But perhaps my favorite feature of all is the ability to cut/copy files on my computer and seamlessly paste to another device/OS. For someone like me that bounces between a variety of devices this feature alone is worth the price of admission.

*Update* It works just fine with the MacBook. I use a USB hub and it seemed to only act up when the Logitech MX Keys keyboard was being used as well. It could have also been when my external hard drive is also plugged into the hub. Basically, what the just the mouse dongle plugged into the hub, everything has worked great so I've upped my rating to 5.This worked beautifully with my old PC. I switched to a MacBook Air M1 and have had nothing but problems, yet for some reason I keep using it. It stutters constantly, lags, loses connection, etc. Same with the keyboard, but the keyboard has been more reliable overall. The scroll wheel is definitely a cool feature. The mouse buttons are a little light, so I'd accidentally right click on things that I didn't mean to. This required me to adjust my grip a little and haven't had many issues since.

I thought new versions bring new and greater things, but apparently not for Logi. MX 2s was a wonderful mouse in many regards, but the mini-USB is showing it's age. Sadly, USB C for charging is the only measurable improvement to 3S. Everything else is not.* if you buy the grey version, the coating becomes visibly dirty very fast.* The back-and-forth buttons are touching the thumb. The back button is so far back it forces one to slide the hand back just for the click.* The thumb down button is limited to a tiny, easy to miss, area, making it uncomfortable to use.* The main buttons have less tactile feel.* The dongle is USB-A, not USB-C. You need an adapter to use with a laptop* The charging indicator is a single LED. You can't estimate the charge left with a glance.I am sticking to 2S.

I have the MX Master 2S and loved everything about that mouse except for the placement of the thumb forward back web browser buttons. Overlapping them means you never click the right one.The MX Master 3 finally separated the buttons so you can distinguish with feel quicker which one you want. The design is slightly different so I will need to get used to it after using the 2S for 2 years....no big deal as its just as comfortable.It's a very precise mouse just like its predecessor. I think the click is more solid and also slightly quieter... I don't know why companies still make the click sound....i kind of feel it's not necessary anymore. Especially if you are click happy like myself.You can customize buttons as needed like other previous models. I have mine hooked up via bluetooth on a mac. You do need to use your old mouse to set things up first as the new mouse isn't connected yet, unless you use the usb plug, then its connectedRecharging is easy with the usb/c connector. I wish that it was usb-c on both sides or at least an adapter included because when i get my new mac i'll now have to get an adapter or unplug usb 3 plugs to recharge. However, it is way easier to recharge as the old usb mini was such a pain to plug into the mouse.Only wish it came in colors too...my fav is blue but maybe in the future?

This is my first MX Master mouse. I plan to use it for my 3d design work, and so far I think it will definitely hold up well. Here are some pros and cons I've observed in my first 24 hours using it. First of all, I absolutely love the scroll wheel. It is quiet, smooth, and very satisfying. I suggest turning up the ""Smartshift Sensitivity"" in the Logitech Options software. That reduces how easily the ratcheting wheel switches to free scrolling. I have it all the way up to like 85%. With this change, it is much more intuitive feeling for me. The laser works great on all surfaces I've tried so far. Bluetooth connection is very responsive, but I had to turn off a setting on my laptop that was putting the bluetooth receiver to sleep after like 3 seconds of inactivity. My complaints are that the gesture button location feels just out of natural reach. I also don't love the grip of it yet, the palm section of the mouse comes out very far which encourages a slightly more vertical grip. I know this is good for me so I'll try to embrace it, but I'm sure it will take some getting used to. All in all it seems like it will be a great mouse.

"
I love the house, but either firmware on the mouser or, more likely the logi software on macOS Monterey stops the scroll wheel and other logi specific functions from working every few days requiring a computer restart to fix. Tries Logi support and they have yet to provide guidance to resolve.

i have been a MX master user ever since the first version. and i didn't know much can be improved when the MX master 3 launched lately. however, i bought one anyways just because.and boy am i impressed.in my opinion, this mouse actually looks less attractive than original MX and MX 2s. where the old MX got that sports car look, the master 3 look a lot more mild with a lot of asymmetric design. however, it does prove to be a better ergonomic  design than the previous two.the main thing it improved upon previous generations are1. battery indicator, now is at a much more obvious place.2. navigation button, now is much easier to reach.3. the thumb pad button.  now it actually felt like a button (i wouldn't be surprised most MX users doesn't even know there is a thumb pad button).4. and most importantly, scrolling wheel feel. it destroies the old MX.  for one, the entire wheel is metal. it feels nice when you use it. and the scrolling action is so smooth and quite, it is gliding. the motion is that much tighter feeling, simply out of this world.5. USB C. yes, finally, USB C for all my devices.6. file copy over multiple machines? haven't tried, but looks pretty awesome.there is one con that i must point out is that by moving the navigation button under the side scrolling wheel, it is harder to reach the side scrolling wheel, especially when you want to move the mouse at the same time. you can no longer preciously move the mouse when your thumb is on the side scrolling, which could drive someone crazy if he/she use this function all the time.

Six months later, from a software developer...The mouse itself is great but many times the custom configuration doesn't work. So off you go to Logitech options where you have to try and re-discover the unifying receiver, and apply logitech options updates... Sometimes that fixes the issue but not usually, but all of that has been done. many times. Move the unifying receiver to another USB port, etc.You have to have Logitech Options to assign and execute the custom setup of your buttons. My center button is the Delete, which is very convenient for deleting lots of emails. But it rarely works.Logitech Options and the device driver detection is unreliable at best. I would not buy this again. I would not recommend this product.

I've had this mouse for 6 months now and I would highly recommend it! I bought mine from a computer store but I wanted to leave a review here because I love this product so much. I was previously using the apple magic mouse but was having wrist pain after spending hours at my computer for work. With the MX 3 I haven't had any wrist pain (though sometimes my fingers need a stretch from clenching it tightly for a long period).My two favorite features are the horizontal scroll wheel and the multi computer pairing (up to 3 computers). It is SO convenient to be able to switch from my laptop to my desktop with the touch of a button (on the bottom of the mouse). It's also a breeze bringing it into the office because of the bluetooth USB that's included. Plug in the USB to the computer and your mouse is good to go on another machine!The battery life is impressive. I've definitely gone at least two weeks without charging it. Unlike Apple's magic mouse -- the charging port is in the front of the mouse so you are able to continue to use the mouse while it's charging. It charges with a USB-C cable.Also the mouse has several different buttons that are customizable to different applications you use. It's a genius feature but I've been too lazy to set it up.I spent more than I thought I ever thought I would on a mouse but it's totally worth it -- especially if you work at a computer for 8+ hours/day.

-Ergonomic from top to bottom-REMARKABLE battery life (charge it maybe once per week, no lie, and I live on my desktop)-Customizable buttons PER APP, or system wide....need I say more?-The gesture button is a godsend, so much that I can't ever picture myself returning to a magic mouse-the scroll wheel is borderline witchcraft-last but certainly not least, the charging port is NOT on the BOTTOM of the doggon MOUSE, cough* MAGIC MOUSE 2 FAIL* cough, but instead, in a perfect, non restrictive location as seen in my 2nd image above.If you still need another reason, your workflow will skyrocket clear through your bedroom ceiling if you customize the buttons with finder for quicker file handling and navigation (map CMD+del ,undo, redo, forward and back = Finder roadrunner machine)

I heavily use the following software:- Revit- Autocad- Bluebeam- ExcelFunctionality:This mouse is by and large the best mouse I have every owned, there are tons of preset options that you can set for the buttons or scroll wheels and if there is not an option listed that you would like you can enter in a keystroke as the function for one of the buttons or scrollers. The scrollers can do more than just move up dwn lft rght or zoom, they can toggle between bluebeam documents, tabs in the browser, views in revit as well as other functions. The support software for the mouse is EXTREMELY responsible and reliable which I love, as soon as you change a setting it is changed there is no latency at all. The 'hyper scroll' feature can be turned off or toned down to whatever sensitivity that you prefer which is nice.By far the best part about the mouse is that you can set different profiles for any program. All programs default to whatever your global setting is but you can set a local setting for everything from scrolling sensitivity to button functionality depending on what program you are using. They have a few programs listed like excel and photoshop or something listed on the website or description as options for making unique profiles but you can set any program to have its own profile. Sort of weird that they would make it feel somewhat exclusive which made me apprehensive when looking to get this mouse.I did not purchase this mouse off of amazon, my company purchased this mouse for me.(in case it lists me as an unverified purchase that is why)

 BT and Logitech USB dongle, it would of been nice for a new mouse like this to use  USB C but I guess they figure there are two customers. Customers using the latest hardware will just connect via BT and those connecting to older type hardware would use the older USB A connection.This mouse is larger than the previous MX version. This mouse is more of a palm mouse rather than one you maneuver with your fingers. It does fit snug within your palm with easy reach to all shortcut buttons and scroll wheels. Mouse is very quiet and precision is spot on for a company that U would expect such quality.Matte grippy rubberized coating.Software is complete with allowing for customization of buttons and shortcuts.Convenient that it charges via USB C, wish  it had a dock to charge rather than having to plug in a cable each time to charge.Super useful that with this day in age everyone has multiple devices and this can be paired with up to three devices with an easy button press underneath.If you like palm mouses with extreme customization, smooth functionality and reliability then Logitech has brought it to the table.

I like this mouse for what it is….I find it a pleasant and shapely fit for my hand that rests my palm and lets my thumb sit comfortably, the scroll wheel is responsive and spiffy, button feedback is great, and it has a nice glide. On its own design merits, I’ve really no complaints and would still be using this aside one major problem.That being, after I began using it, my PC would randomly lock up and not awaken from my screensaver, and sometimes would even lock up in the midst of me doing some productivity for which I’d need to hard reboot my rig (and frustratingly, lose my progress). Oftentimes I would move the mouse after having not used my PC for a while to see no cursor response until about a second to two later, which indicates that it was sleeping and reawakening with new input. After much headache and freaking out believing this freezing was an issue with my hardware or OS, I began unplugging and trouble shooting all my external HDDs and peripherals. Nothing fixed it until I unplugged this mouse for another.Apparently this doesn’t appear to be a widespread issue, at least from what I can gather looking at the reviews and around the net, it just doesn’t jive with my PC, which is why I’m not giving it one star. I like it, I simply can’t use it.Just be aware….if your PC begins to freeze, this may be the culprit. Can’t imagine I’m alone with this issue.

I upgraded to the MX Master 3 from a Logitech M510, and am very happy with it so far. It has a unique look for a mouse, but it's very comfortable to hold. The size is just right, and it feels ergonomically-friendly. Vertical scrolling is super smooth, which is a big difference from my previous mouse. The thumb wheel on the side helps navigate wide documents and spreadsheets.I use a mouse for things like photo editing, text editing, and gaming, so I’m finding all the extra features very useful. For those who want to get into specific customization, the Logitech Options software lets you tweak the scrolling speed, direction, sensitivity, etc. There are many more options than any mouse I've had so far. It also allows you to copy text from one computer and paste it on another, which is a cool feature.As far as compatibility, the MX Master 3 can work with three different computers. I’m using it with two: a Windows and a Mac. Switching back and forth is very easy. There’s a little button on the bottom to switch between computers. It also works with Linux.It connects via a small plug-in USB receiver or via Bluetooth. Those with newer Macs that have only the USB-C slots will need to connect via Bluetooth or use a USB adapter.This mouse has been great so far, and I’ve had no trouble with it. It's accurate, feels well-made, and makes working on the computer much easier for me.

I've been a Logitech user for 20+ years. I always loved their gear. I was super excited to get this mouse to replace my trusty MX Pro mouse that recently developed issues with the primary button after about 8 years. This new mouse is a NIGHTMARE.The awful SmartShift scroll wheel is impossible to use. One gently flick and I'm 100 pages down a document. It doesn't click or ratchet anymore, it constantly unlocks to smooth scrolling and I'm lost in my document. Scrolling is literally impossible now.I thought, ""no problem, there must be away to disable this useless crap."" So I installed the Logitech Options app, and yes it does disable that garbage. But it also replaces mousing and scrolling for the entire system. This has two huge drawbacks. One, I'm constantly nagged with permissions requests in macOS to allow this mouse to ""control my system"", which I granted, but the even bigger problem is once I set all the permissions to finally be correct, the mouse is still broken. If I zoom into the screen using Control+scroll wheel, an accessibility feature that I use constantly, the mouse suddenly has no idea where the cursor is anymore. And the scroll wheel doesn't work. It scrolls lists or windows that are nowhere near where my cursor is, and will not scroll what I'm hovering over. The app is completely broken in terms of knowing where the cursor is and scrolling whatever object is under the mouse cursor.I have no idea how this mouse has such high reviews. I guess I'm the only one that uses the screen zooming feature. The worst thing is, all of their new mice have this insane ""SmartShift electromagnetic scroll wheel"" gimicky crap. So now it looks like I can never buy another Logitech mouse again. I don't want to have to install an app to control how the scroll wheel works. These things always have bugs and stability issues. I just want a normal mouse with a normal scroll wheel.Good lord Logitech, why did you have to break something that was so good? Beyond frustrating. Now the hunt begins for a usable mouse. Ugh....

This mouse seems to be a downgrade from its previous version. Since I misplaced my Master 2S, I was pleasantly noted that there is a newer version, so I happily ordered one.  What a mistake. It feels lighter, smaller, and cheaper.  The extreme annoy thing is that since it is lighter, and its bottom is extremely slippery, it is very easy to be moved. As such the mouse pointer is very hard to be controlled, the pointer tends to always overshoot its locations.  Very unhappy.

"
This mouse causes me discomfort in minutes. Not a good fit for my hand. But it does have a nice rubber grip, nice texture to the buttons, nice clickiness, fun scroll wheel (I don't experience the scroll issues others mention, perhaps those have been addressed) alas, all for naught in my case. For reference, I find the microsoft sculpt ergonomic mouse a very natural fit in my hand.
",3
"
I have both the mx master 3 and the 2S. I was very satisfied by the 2S and decided buying the new model for work. Unfortunately, the scrolling is horrible. It misses wheel ticks and doesn't register every motion of the wheel. I feel like I'm struggling for the mouse to understand me.Other than that, it is very ergonomic and nice. But the scrolling is very crucial for me, I consider going back to my 5$ mouse.
",3
"
The mouse feels fantastic, I love the way it moves and feels, I like the button placement. When I compare it to the G502, the MX just feels much better in my hand.But the scroll wheel is just bad. It works, but it's janky and inconsistent. Tried all the different settings. Based on the other reviews, I doubt this is just a defective unit. May try to RMA.

I will keep this review short and simple.I had mx vertical mouse. Due to the less feature like side scroll and hyper scroll i tried to use this one though mc vertical is one of the best ergonomic mouse out there.Pros :- Has better grip.- Good placement of forward and backward button and easy to access it unlike mx vertical.- Button click is really tactile and smooth.- multi device feature is great best part of most logitech devices.Cons:- Biggest complaint of this mouse which makes this mouse useless is scroll. You will find many article and complain about this mouse on reddits.Mouse scroll most of the time act wired some it lags and freeze and do not react on scroll Very buggy and will drive you crazy about this.I have used many mouse in past even cheaper mouse like $15 has very very good accuracy.- I have asked to logitech support team for help.Being all the feature and build quality due to lack of accuracy in scroll I will definitely will not recommend. Since this mouse is not cheap. Cheaper mouse does much much better than this.** DO NOT GO WITH THE HYPE**Look for scroll issue about this mouse online and you will find so many complaints and logitech did not solve it  with the new release.

Smooth and precise, but this mouse is just too small. I haven't had a decent size mouse since my Logitech MX Laser. Could also be tilted forward and to the right a little more for better large-hand ergonomics. None of this is an issue for most people, but I needed a mouse I could use extensively for 8-12 hrs per day. My wrist hurts now.

"
There is a Mac version of this mouse but this is not it.  The Mac version is the same price and you can find it on Amazon.

I got this mouse as a gift. I am a happy user of the first generation of the MX Master (almost 3 years) and very briefly used the second generation.The Mx Master 3 is a step back in ergonomics for me because the top of the mouse is not as ""flat"" on the previous models and that ""spike"" that is roughly between the thumb and the index finger is poking into the hand, making it uncomfortable.The button under the thumb is impossible to press, since it so much smaller. The original mouse has the button set such, that one can press it with the side of the thumb (the button as raised above the surrounding surface). The new model has the button surrounded by rigid edges under the soft cover, so that the button does not protrude (the button is recessed - that's fine for a button on a wall, but absolutely not for a button that is supposed to be pressed by the side of a thumb). My thumb essentially rests on the two edges of the button and I cannot just roll it and press it like I can on the MX Master 1. (See photo).Generally, the mouse is not as comfortable. The thumb wheel is not close to the thumb, so the thumb needs to move up about 1 cm to even touch the side scroll.The ""freespin"" does not spin as long as it does on the first generation. It is noticeably slower, therefore it stops earlier. It does not feel even a little bit more precise or faster as advertised.While it is quieter, the scroll is mushy, does not react to fast movements.If anyone is looking into getting a mouse from the Master series, you'd be better off buying the previous models, especially since they are much cheaper now that the third model is out.

I had the original MX for a number of years but it finally wore out.  Bought this one simply because I liked the original so much.  Well, sometimes the newest isn't the best. Returned this one for the following reasons:  (1) The number of programmable buttons actually decreased (2) the ""forward"" and ""back"" buttons on the side are too small, too close together and very ""sharp"".  Using them was not natural and just a few clicks of the sharp edges had my fingers hurting within a morning's use (3) the biggest reason I returned it is the scroll wheel is positioned too far forward. I could only reach it with the tip of my finger vs. the ""fatty"" part of my finger and (4) if you look at the scroll wheel you'll notice it has a serrated pattern. Once again, after just one morning of use my finger tips were getting irritated and sore.  Software and programming of keys was a snap.  But the comfort and ""natural fit"" just wasn't there. If you have a small or regular sized hand I think you might find this mouse uncomfortable.

This mouse, while it seems to perform well, is monstrous!  If they had a smaller version, maybe I'd be interested, but at this size?  Forget it....

The mouse worked really well.  However, the Mouse broke 8 months after purchase and logitech support was no help and would not replace mouse.

Buggy. Horizontal scroll doesn’t work with all apps, and with the ones it does it can be intermittent. Switching between devices is super convenient but maybe once a month the connection drops and I have to reboot to get it working again. Save your money; not worth $100. At this price point it should be flawless.

scroll wheel fails daily, no response from customer service, no warranty coverageseriously obstructing work flow, waste of $100

Scroll wheel doesn't register for two clicks of the wheel after clicking the left button. Scrolling is inconsistent. Using this mouse is so frustrating I'm returning it.
",1

The scrolling issue makes it unusable. Occasionally the scrolling wheel stops responding which causes erratic scrolls. It’s hard to control and predict how turning the wheel will scroll the current screen. I had this issue on Mac OS, not sure if this is also present in other operating systems, though user reports say it’s the same and that it’s just a hardware flaw.

Just after a year of owning it won't stay connected to any of my devices. It will work for 30 min and then has to be paired again in order to work.

I did not like this mouse at all and it was returned the day I got it. The thumb section feels horrible as the two cheap mushy buttons jam into your thumb in standard holding position. This alone made it absolutely useless to me. I cannot believe (according to other reviews) that other users can actually tolerate this incredibly annoying shortcoming.

I have used the previous version of this mouse for a long time and it has been by far my favorite mouse of all time, so much so that i would bring it everywhere with me despite its large size.  I bought the MX3 so that i could just keep my MX2 at the officePros:- ergonomic shape is good (but not as good as mx2)- can use bluetooth or a usb dongle to connect.- can easily switch between multiple connected computers- thumb wheel is great for photo/video editing and for spreadsheet scrolling- love the customization options for the fwd/back and thumb buttons!Cons:- $$$$- MX3 not as comfortable as previous versions and doesn’t add much new functionality (recommend you buy the much cheaper mx2)- DON’T BUY MAC ONLY VERSION- you can get all the same customizable features on the regular version and it comes with a dongle.- if ergonomics is your goal, get the vertical wrist version instead

This is how big mice should be. This makes conventional mice feel like toys.  The ability to switch the wheel from ratchet mode to free spin is great.  It also tracks better than any mouse I have used.For the price, I am somewhat disappointed.  I have (still) a Logic G13 and have every single button programmed and used.  I have a G710+ with every programmable button programmed and used.  There is no such capability in this mouse.  Of all companies, Logitec should know their customers want that capability.  I would suspect that customers who want to program the thumb buttons and wheel out-number the customers who want to use the same mouse automatically on 2 computers by 10 to 1.  So we have a relatively useless feature but not a helpful one.  This can be fixed and I hope they wake up to the issue.You get a great mouse, but it isn't Logitec smart, but

I thought the first unit I got was faulty, but after discovering the inconsistently-working scroll wheel I noticed other people having the same issue with this mouse, in the reviews.  I got a replacement, and it's exactly the same.  It's a design flaw, not a malfunction.Both scroll-wheels are affected.  Equal flicks and movements of the wheels produces different results.  Sometimes wheel spins do almost nothing.  I've also noticed right-click button not responding occasionally.  I'm pretty turned-off by Logitech after this waste of time.For $100 bucks this mouse should be perfect, but it can't even get the basics right.

Love this mouse as a creator and editor for our photo/video biz. For video timeline, the side rolling knob is awesome for speeding up video editing and the assignable buttons are a great option. To be able to select the top scroll wheel to “freewheel” or have the normal “click” resistance is another great feature! The shape and fitness to one’s hand is above reproach and cannot be compared to anything else on the market! Would give this mouse 10 Stars if possible! Another home run hit by Logitech. I also have the MX Keys which is just as wonderful a product. Both work great with my Apple MacBook Pro 2021 M1 Max 16” and my HP laptop and Desktop, easily selectable and can drag documents and photos between all 3 easily! 👍👍👍

So I never thought I'd buy a $100 Bluetooth mouse, but I received several Amazon gift cards for graduation so I said what the heck. This thing is PERFECT for what I do. I use a 35"" curved monitor at home so the horizontal scrolling feature is very useful. The customizable buttons via the Logitech software are great too. I can appreciate the adjusted placement of the thumb button (in previous models it was not in a user-friendly location). I've only used it via BT and it connects quickly. Battery life is excellent.Overall, VERY satisfied, would recommend, and would definitely buy again!

It is both ergonomic and functional. You can program buttons with a wide choice of options. Another nice feature is the mouse is extremely quiet. Installation and setup was very easy. What I find quite amazing is with all the buttons, I never accidentally hit one of those programmable buttons. A mouse is a mouse and then there is this mouse,  a mouse that looks great and combines function with smooth operation.I have it connected via the USB dongle connected to a USB 3.0 hub that connects to my computer. Using the unifying software makes it easier to install mouse and MX Keys keyboard. Of course, that is when connecting via USB as opposed to bluetooth. Overall I think this mouse pairs excellently with the MX Keys Keyboard.

"
Love the feel of this mouse, everything about it feels premium and comfortable. I especially love the quiet metal scroll wheels over the previous mx  masters. I was surprised at how light it was though, maybe just personal preference but I’d love a little more weight so it doesn’t take so much effort to make precise movements, maybe adjustable weights in the mx master 4?

For years, I used a standard mouse properly set for photo work. I then found WACOM INTUOUS2, which I again used for several more years. Recently, I moved into a BENQ monitor, and decided that I really wanted to go back to more of a standard mouse type. After a bit of research, I decided on this one and I am very pleased with all this mouse has to offer. It's ease of use with the photo work has saved some time, and is very accurate. Due to the great fit in my hand, my wrist and hand have been able to relax too, which has made some long hours less painful, and even pleasant. It's a good one.

I make graphics and I game.  My mouse needs to be very accurate. For me, a wired mouse was always tried and true.  No interference, no batteries to change, etc.  After 35 years of using corded mice (Since the Atari 1040ST days) I finally broke down and went with the Master 3.  I normally bought all my corded mice from Logitech, so it was given I would use them to try this out.  It really is such a nice mouse.  It's a pleasure to use. It has a wonderful hand feel, and the rechargeable battery lasts a long long while.  If you're in the market for a wireless mouse or are coming over from corded mice - you owe it to yourself to give this a try.

You don't know what you're missing in a mouse until you get this device. I'm a Logitech 705 guy. Bought 705s for my workers and my home PCs.This one blows it away. Its smooth in every respect. No stress on your hand at all. It matches the curvature of your hand without getting in the way. I'm sure you've tried those other type of mice.It is smoother than anything I've ever used. I use it on world of warships and its just fine. My son said it might not keep up with the massively fast games. I dunno since I don't have time to play those.I recommend the purchase.

Great.  I love the defaults for programs you can load, except for Excel.  Why in the world would they make the back and forward side buttons default to UNDO/REDO?  I can keep my left hand on keyboard for that, but if I wanted to change sheets (tabs) in an excel workbook you have to press CTRL PG up/down, or use the mouse.  So I had to re program the back/forward buttons to flip through tabs in excel quickly.Also, the sideways scroll in excel is BACKWARD from what you may think.  Or at least how I think it should be.  WIth all the options they give you with their software, they don't allow you to reverse the direction of sideways scroll.Side scroll isn't hyper fast, but it is smooth.

"
So far, this is the best wireless mouse I've bought.  It's super ergonomic and not nearly as big and heavy as many reviews seem to suggest.  I will be using it for my laptop, so I'll be traveling quite a bit with it and I do not see it being an issue.The buttons it has for various functions are well thought out, extremely useful, and convenient.Lastly, I bought it to use with an MX Keys keyboard and I love the fact that it connects to multiple devices and allows you to do this via one dongle (or bluetooth) instead of needing one for each.

Is it a mouse? Is it a cylon fighter? This thing looks a little strange but it's the best mouse I've ever used. I never thought I'd want to spend a lot on a mouse but I needed something more ergonomic. I tried the Logitech vertical mouse but I found that this one was more comfortable. Worked great right out of the box. And USB C is the icing on the cake.

I work with CAD on multiple machines daily.  I also video conference from multiple machines daily.  This is a game changer for me.  I no longer have to use my KVM switch to change machines to answer calls and my CAD shortcuts that I programmed into my mouse work identically on both machines.  I also got the MX keys keyboard so when I Flow from one machine to the next, the keyboard comes along.  I can also copy and paste from one machine to the other.  Unbelievable!  This is more than I expected.  Highly recommend.  Don't worry about scroll wheel speed.  It is not super fast all of the time.  That is a choice.  It is super precise for me.

I have been using this for a couple of weeks now.  Battery life is better than I expected, love the versatility of the programable buttons and wheels - this is the perfect mouse for heavy duty excel use.

I suggest going ahead and getting the protective case while you are at it as you will want to take it with you.

Nice upgrade over the mx master. I use a glorious wrist pad with it. Side scroller is awesome for productivity and gaming (when the game allows it). The vertical scroller is amazing and a big improvement over the original.Battery life is insane. For charging it upgradea from micro to usb-c which is convenient. Uses the same usb adapter by logitech.Worth getting if in your budget. Really hard to get big mice that feel good in a big person's hands.

This mouse was simple to set up in about 15 seconds: plug in the dongle, and turn on the mouse. It worked perfectly at that point. Looks like great quality. Scrolling was easy. Buttons work well. Resolution is on target, not too high and not too low. I like the USB-C recharging, hard to find in a product like this. This is great for a temporary office or on business trips, where portability is needed. It's lighter than I expected.
",5
"
Beautiful mouse, fantastic quality construction and button layout.Unfortunately this mouse is not ergonomic and will not improve your wrist pain.Personally I found this to be kind of a hybrid mouse between a standard flat model and a vertical model.So if you like regular mice and want something that is slightly more ergonomic with an amazing scroll wheel give it a shot.If you're looking for a replacement to your current vertical mouse look elsewhere.

I have been using most all of the Logitech mice for years.  This verified purchase was an upgrade from the MX Master 2S. I had been using that one on 2 home desktops and 1 work desktop.  This MX Master 3 is certainly an upgrade.  The magnetic metal scroll wheel and the USB C did it for me.  The button placements and the application functions were great too.  I just ordered a 2nd one.  3rd will not be long behind.

I normally buy gaming mice for better resolution on my multi screen environment.. but they have lost quality over time... now it's not if the mouse will break but when..That said, the Logitech seem to be built better.. this one and my anywhere 2s is tough and doesn't break.. they are not ideal for gaming, but they are robust enough to outlive gaming mice

I was skeptical at first paying this much for a mouse but wow it's the best mouse I've ever owned. It connected with very little effort using the bolt dongle and I love the customization options. Some thoughts:- The horizontal scroll wheel is pretty handy though it takes a little getting used to. I kept hitting the two buttons underneath it instead.- The thumb button is fantastic at it's default setting to see an overview of all my open windows. Sometimes it's hard to activate but maybe I just need to get used to it as well.- I love the ability to change how the vertical wheel scrolls. It's extremely quick- Ergonomically, this fits my hand like a glove. It's perfect for me.All in all, completely happy with this purchase.

So far I like the mouse.I really like the gestures function, and plan on testing to see if it works in games.The mouse is pretty big, so if your hands are small it's the wrong mouse for you.I wear medium latex gloves at work, and I found the mouse to almost be too large. It'd be more comfortable if it was 10% smaller. Not sure how logitech screws up the little thingsHere's my big gripes:THE SOFTWARE- I cant make macros when my other logitech mice can using their gaming software- At work I can't use their flow function because my work laptop is on different network than personal laptop, when I press the button on my logitech MX keys keyboard to switch input the mouse should follow, but instead I gotta flip the mouse over to press the button.- I'd like gestures to include more options, you can only do gesture button + up,down,left,right. I'd like to make more complex gestures to assign to less often used functions. Logitech's problem has always been the software, the tech can do these things if they'd get the software right.

How are there reviews other than 5 stars on this mouse?  It is comfortable, premium feeling, and unbelievably customizable.  Bluetooth functions perfect as well as the unifying receiver.  I could not get the mouse to show up in Logitech Options when connected via Bluetooth for some strange reason.

I wanted a comfortable, bluetooth mouse to clean up my desktop (I run my MacBook Pro Air in clamshell mode and wanted to clean up my docking station and remove unneeded connections). This paired easily with my laptop via bluetooth so I don't have to use the included USB dongle, freeing up a USB port. The MagSpeed scroll wheel is incredible! By clicking the mode shift button on top you can change between a ratcheted feel to a soundless, free spin which is SO SMOOTH! The ""1 min charge provides 3 hrs use"" is terrific in those crunch situations that you don't have time to wait for a full charge. There are more options than I need and will see if I can make the time to figure them all out (and/or customize it). Most of all... this mouse is comfortable! If you spend enough time using a mouse (even if just surfing)... your hand will thank you for the ergonomic position of rest. Highly recommend this mouse if you can tolerate the price tag. I've only had it for a few days, but have not had any connectivity and or jerkiness issues as some reviews I've read. I have it sitting right next to my Apple bluetooth keyboard and both seem to work perfectly.

Excellent mouse - fits well in the hand, nice and weighty but not so heavy it's hard to move. The scroll wheels feel good, particularly the thumb scroll wheel feels nice and premium. A reasonable amount of customization, though it's not a gaming mouse so don't expect hardcore macro programming.

This mouse is great. It feels comfortable in your hand and like a premium product. It has a nice heft to it, and the details of the metal scroll wheels are great. The rubber is soft and grippy without feeling cheap. The buttons are responsive and clicky. Switching between computers with the Bluetooth selector is seamless and fast.Highly recommend this mouse for productivity tasks. I don’t do a ton of gaming, so I’m not sure how great it is for it.

I just bought this to get a nice reliable wireless mouse. And I have been pleasantly surprised time and time again. The scroll wheel is incredible. The wheel will freespin for literally 25 seconds, which is very useful for scrolling through long pages of code or long comment sections. The battery seems to last at least 2-3 weeks per charge, I haven't actually fully drained it yet. The button on the bottom lets you switch between devices, which is very handy. However, I did find that doing this on linux mint 20 would sometimes mess up the scrolling speed, making it extremely sensitive, requiring a disconnect and reconnect of the bluetooth device to repair, which kind of negates the usefulness of device switching feature a bit. But this is not a huge deal.The shape was a bit weird at first, but after a week I've come to really like it. I wish the forward/back thumb buttons on the mouse were a bit bigger. Also sometimes it takes 2-3 seconds to wake from sleep mode, which can be a little bit annoying sometimes, but it's not too bad.All in all, pretty good mouse. It is expensive but the super long battery life and the mousewheel that's basically a built in fidget-spinner makes this a fun way to use the computer. 9/10

Having had numerous mice for my computers, both Apple and Windows, logitech makes the absolute best - much superior to the Apple mouse in my experience, and this model is the best one yet, and I have had a few of them!

I bought this to pair with a MacBook Air and to run a DAW aside from general emails and surfing. I LOVE the fact that it's rechargeable...and yes the charge seems to last for quite awhile, but I'd rather keep it topped-off than run it down too much. It's certainly the largest mouse I've ever owned...but unquestionably also the most ergonomic. I haven't mapped-out all the button assignments yet as I haven't decided what I really need in that regard yet. But I really like the mouse. I will say that at times, it can be too easy to do a left or right mouse click unwantedly, so I'm still getting used to it....and because I haven't grown-in to it yet, and the mouse is $100, I've giving 4 instead of five stars. But I may revisit this and revise the review in the near future.

"
The mouse is pretty expensive, but I finally made the decision to purchase this because I considered the number of times I use a mouse. It's really comfortable to use, and all the extra programmable buttons really make a difference, though it takes some time to adjust to using these instead of doing what you would normally do. The biggest difference is the infinite scroll wheel, it makes scrolling through pages is so effortless. Once you get used to it, it makes it difficult to use any other since most other mice are lacking in comparison.

I know it works well because when I use a normal mouse, my arm and shoulder pain return.It worked so well my wife took it from me and I had to order another!Highly recommended for WFH use and office use.

I can confirm all of the nice things others have and will say about this, but I won't repeat them. Instead I will mention the one feature that I love.  I bought this just to have it as a standby to use in rare cases where I need to scroll in both directions (big Excel sheet). I didn't think I would be using it regularly because I have my keyboard and mouse perched on the drawer of my desk, and the mouse is allocated three inches of width.  As such, I've been using a trackball for years and expected to continue to do so. But I have found that this mouse works perfectly well within that three inches!  I can move the cursor all around my 28 inch screen and never have to lift and double back. So it has replaced my trackball. The scrolling is awesome.

My previous mouse was the MX Master 2. This new MX Master 3s is better in texture and button layout out. I use this mouse for my computer designer needs. It works flawlessly and I highly recommend this mouse.

1st: Don't plug this into a KVM switch. The device wasn't even recognized in XP this way. I'll just buy another USB Logi Bolt. Heh.2nd: My vintage Win98SE gaming computer is quite special. I had the huge serial Kensington Trackball plugged in. It's also running the ""Kernel Ex"" extensions for Win98SE. (Very good BTW) Lots of HW had been installed on it, and been unplugged over the years. I programmed chips from MicroChip too. So... Lots of drivers.What happened? How?Fascinating journey. :)Well, the driver for ""USB receiver"" appeared like XP (don't know where it got that from, possibly the old XBox 360 wireless game controllers driver ""XBCD"" -worked good), and... USB Rec. Kept appearing over and over...Uh oh. So I hit cancel, and noticed that the mouse was working in Win98SE!!!Rebooted. Froze. Uh oh.Booted in safe mode, on a lark, disabled the USB Receiver device (only 1 entry was there, huh).Rebooted. Now it seems to continue to run without it enabled.So I have the later Logitech Mouse Ware 9.79.025 (probably doesn't matter precisely)Trackball's still working fine.So- An interesting result!I'll keep this shiny new mouse!Got lucky I guess.On my Win10 5ablet, I had to install both Chrome and the LogiBolt WebApo because their native app wouldn't start. Maybe it's Win11or doesn't run on an Atom CPU???I had a 2nd LogiBolt I wanted to sync to my mouse's channel 2. You MUST run LogiBolt to do this. The CSR wanted me to return it. This would've been a complete waste of time.SSD Opinion:Keep backing up your computers, BTW, I went back to physical HDDs.I can't trust these SSDs. I've been through 6 of them now on both computers.So so fast. And so so sad.So... No. Not for me. Not anymore.I had the XP ones optimized.Just saying...It's pretty sad when a disc scan starts showing up the bad blocks everywhere...Usually a HDD will give you a chance to rescue things, but an SSD can just CEASE on you.

Good luck getting smooth cursor movement and a reliable connection.  Millions of features are pointless if the connection endlessly breaks.The software has no connection related info so you are on your own.  I guess it would be pointless to add since when the connection weakens, you can't use the app anyway.One the PC processor goes under load, the connection weakens and the mouse is unpredictable.The forward back buttons are strangely too far back.  The most used ""back"" button requires you to slide your hand back from the resting position.Not sure what the battery light is saying.  Sometimes it's lit green, sometimes off.  No paper manual provided.Not sure what the forward button on the bottom means.  Is it a toggle between USB/BT or just BT on/off?The slanted form factor is easy to hold but places your palm weight on your small wrist bone (pisiform).  I see problems with this over time.

I've had the MX Master 2, 2S and now the 3. There's a reason I keep coming back to this mouse. It's great for productivity. Every button is programmable and it has just enough buttons to be useful, but not so many that you'll forget which one does what. The ergonomics are much improved from the previous version.The construction of these mice is as good as mice come. It better be for the price. The texture is smooth with a subtle tooth to is so my hands rarely get sweaty when the gaming gets intense. Speaking of gaming, you can game on this mouse. It's a little on the heavy side but I've found the latency to be near zero for a wireless mouse so long as you stick to the dongle.Speaking of the dongle, the wireless reception can take some finessing. It can make it through your desk but I have found that it can suffer from interference if you have a computer or something in between the mouse and the dongle. Once you figure out your setup, it is as reliable as death & taxes. The tracking on this mouse is absolutely perfect. It even tracks on glass and although the sensitivity appears to take a slight hit, it is probably imperceptible for most people.As I mentioned before, I've been using some variant of this mouse for the past 4-5 years. I have found that it is very comfortable and ergonomic. I never feel any fatigue after using it even if I find myself playing video games for extended sessions.  The scroll wheel is great with the two modes. I find the clicked mode is more practical in everyday use. When you spin it quickly, it unclicks and rolls smoothly, perfect for long pages, PDF's, or timelines in your video editing program of choice, this can be switched back & forth on the fly.. While we're on the topic of configuration. every button can be changed to do whatever. I sort of wish there was one more button for the pinky, but that could screw up the ergonomics. The side scroll wheel on thumb is useful but not the most ergonomic. Not really sure how it can be improved as it its better than the previous version.Battery life is good, I don't find it annoying to plug it in about every 10 days to 2 weeks. The LED indicator let's you know at least 3-4 hours of constant use before you need to plug it in. I'll sometimes ignore the light and it'll keep chugging for another day.Lastly, it can be paired with multiple devices in one of two ways. Once you experience this level of convenience, you'll never want to go back. A simple button press on the bottom of the mouse (so you don't accidentally swap machines) and you are instantly paired with another machine. I use a PC workstation, a mac for work and an iPad as my laptop replacement. I have all 3 paired at once.Are you ready for the Caddy of wireless mice? You can't do much better than this guy.

This is an excellent mouse.But the side wheel customization is difficult on some computers. And the side wheel software could give you a headache or might not work. But overall I recommend this mouse. I liked a lot how long it lasts with one charge. I wish if the mouse size is a little bigger. Also I wish if the side buttons are lower and larger. The side wheel feels great. But good luck getting it to give the custom commands you prefer.

Bought this for remote office work, and it's very comfortable and the silent click is very satisfying. Color isn't pure white but close enough to match my white/pink keyboard. Connectivity and battery life are both excellent. Hubby loves this MX Master so bought at least 5 from gen 2 to this 3S. Overall it's wonderful for hand of all sizes (I have small hand). He used it for light gaming before and said it's fine. More serious gaming it's recommended to use gaming mouse (latency, less tiring, and also smooth mouse navigation). Thank you for reading my feedback.

I can't say it enough, if you are an office worker or use a mouse all the time, buy a good mouse. Don't skimp on your comfort and well being. This is an amazingly comfortable mouse and they last a super long time, I've owned the MX Revolution (2008), which I still have and use. Then I got the MX Master in 2019 and now this one, which is by far the best one. You can recharge it through USB-C, you can connect through Bluetooth, USB Adapter and you can connect up to 3 devices, Mac or PC. I just wish Logitech would bring back a mouse docking station. They had it for the Revolution and it was the best thin ever. LoL

I have been an MX mouse user for the last 5 years. I need a new mouse for my remote office laptop and I transfter my 5 years old MX Master to that computer.

I love the USB C charging and the mousse texture is plesnent in my palm. Overall, another good mouse from Logitech.

I was tired of the magic mouse. I only liked the ability to swipe/tap the magic mouse to go between desktops and whatnot. Oh and the scrolling; the soft scrolling on magic mice is actually really good.The ability to customize the MX Master 3S (newest version) and all its benefits makes this mouse a lot better than the magic mouse. The gesture button allows me to swipe between desktops. It takes a little getting used to but feels natural in no time. Along with the gesture button, there are two thumb buttons that defaults to back and forward in your browser. Right above the 2 thumb buttons, there's a horizontal scroll wheel. On top of the mouse, you have the standard 3 buttons for right, left, and a middle clicking vertical scroll wheel. Right under the scroll wheel is another button that allows you change the type of scrolling function from smooth to ratchet or the clicky line by line kind of scrolling. Underneath, you'll find a slider to select the connection method (bluetooth/usb) as well as a button to be able to connect your mouse to 3 separate systems. In the very front of the mouse is a USB-C port for charging. I haven't tested if this also allows another method of connecting to your system.All these buttons are fully customizable using the Logi Options+ app. From the app, you control everything. You can also setup different customization profiles per app and switching is seamless. You don't have to do any activating.I'm also using this for gaming. Sometimes I need to switch from my mac to my windows laptop and the selector button on the bottom makes that simple. It is a bit annoying that I have to lift the mouse and push the button, but you can also have any of the other buttons perform this function.Smooth scrolling works well, but it doesn't beat the magic mouse scrolling. I'm not sure what it is, but if you don't really care about having the scrolling silky smooth, it won't be an issue. As I mentioned above, there's smooth and ratchet scrolling. A button beneath the scroll wheel allows you to easily select.It's only been 6 days and the battery is at 70%. I'm on my laptop longer than I should be, pulling 8-9 hour work days, and gaming for 2-3 hours after that. I do a lot of switching between desktops, scrolling pages, and play WoW and CoD. Battery life seems to be really solid. No complaints there so far. Plus the charge port is in the front of the mouse so you can still use it.All in all, I love this mouse. I can get my work done, then play my games right after.

First, let me say that I love the Logitech's Keys (keyboard) with the MX Master 3 Mouse combo! It took a while to set up with my iMac and Windows 10 devices. There's some issues here but a quick update to the Logi Options firmware fixed the issue I was having with using Flow between my Mac and my work Windows PC. That being said, here is my review of just the mouse.The mouse was initially comfortable but I quickly realized that my ring and pinky finger were being curled in, which makes the comfort sub-par for me. I typically have ""medium"" sized hands (as gloves go) and this mouse is slightly too small for my liking. It's not a deal-breaker but I wish there was a bit more surface to the right of the mouse, like my previous trackball mouse which allowed me to put all my fingers comfortably on the mouse itself. Currently the right-side drops vertically so my 2 fingers have to curl in or just drag on the desk; both which are slightly uncomfortable, especially for long use.I've only been using this mouse since I busted it out of the box today but the build quality and matte finish are very nice. The scrollwheel is also a good as others have mentioned and spins nicely, allowing me to speed-scroll long pages.To Logitech - I would give this mouse a 5 out of 5 stars if it had more surface area on the right. Although it would make the mouse larger, it would greatly improve the comfort level for any users that have a medium or larger hand.So far so good. I'll update if anything changes but right now, I'm quite enjoying the Logitech keyboard and mouse combo.UPDATE:Too good to be true. While the initial switching option was nice, it's a bit buggy and I can't get it to work consistently and not sure what the issue is. So as of now, I'm having to switch manually using the buttons :(.UPDATE2:I haven't found any solution or update to solve the issue with flow not always working but a soft restart appears to help.UPDATE3:I may have found a ""better"" solution/setup. The mouse/keyboard is connected to the Windows PC via the Unifying Receiver and connected to the Mac via bluetooth, the switching/connectivity is consistently more stable. So far, its gone all day and works approximately 80% of the time. Still hope Logitech has an update to remedy this but so far so good...-ish.UPDATE 4:Been several months and I haven't had any success getting Flow to work again with my Mac/Windows PC setup. Even after numerous tries, restarts, uninstalls/reinstalls, and support community, nothing works. I've brought my rating as now it's nearly as inconvenient as having 2 sets of keyboard/mice. Quite unfortunate. As of this last update, if you want to pair Mac and a Windows PC, please take note.

I use my mouse full time. It fits my hand so comfortably that it is just a joy to use. I downloaded the Logitech software which allowed me to setup advanced features. One thing I have heard is that this is not an ideal gaming mouse but that is not an issue for me. Not that you can't use it for games, but serious gamers might not be satisfied.

Talk about a cooool mouse! I purchased this along with the MX Keys to create the best multi-device experience and it has not let me down. I'm not a huge computer gamer so I can't speak to that aspect, but I can fully attest to the ergonomic structure of this mouse for everyday use. It feels like a very natural placement for your hand and I've yet to have any sense of fatigue after several hours per day. It also looks really nice in both grey/white (second one purchased for my partner who's also a huge fan!).

This is hands down the best mouse I ever owned. This mouse is incredibly comfortable in the hand, has a nice weight to it, and I really really like the silent switches that they incorporated in this model. My desk is in the living room so having silent clicks on my mouse is a must and logitech weren't making any full sized mice with silent clicking until just recently with this model. So as soon as I hear about this I snatched one up and I'm very glad that I did. I would recommend this mouse to anyone, it is phenomenal.

Normally I have a lot to say. This is the first time I've really just been floored by how great the product is. My previous mouse was a razer basilisk that was wireless. I enjoyed the feature, but over time the scroll wheel started giving me real problems. So one mouse goes to rma, 2nd mouse begins to do it too. I decide to get this one after researching other brands and different builds.I wear large size gloves. this thing is pretty good to compromise between my own hand and my wife's medium hand for our gaming pc. Wireless works without a hitch, and the scroll wheel is superior.Battery life for wireless functionality is great. I'm currently on about 2 weeks without it touching a charger. That's with nearly every night being the sims 4 or Battlefield 2042.

Once configured, this makes the 3 button mice you've likely been using for years seem like they are in the stone age. A common complaint about this mouse is the scroll wheel. I was having problems as well, with it clicking/making noise and not responding well. It works great since I changed the scroll wheel mode from ratchet to free spin.The ability to seamlessly control multiple computers from one mouse is a killer feature. Soon after purchasing this, I picked up the MX keys to go with it.

Great mouse, I hesitated to get this mouse as I have a g502, but for work, I dived in.To be honest, this is a great mouse overall.

I must tell ya'll... I am loving this mouse! I spend a lot of time on the computer. Between being a full-time data analyst and then graduate school... I literally use the computer everyday. I have gone through numerous mice and because I have a laptop I will just stop using them because I find that many are not comfortable to use for long periods of time.This one deserves a gold crown. First - it fits my hand perfectly. I do have pretty small hands so I can't speak for everybody.The response time is crazy fast. The scroll wheel is super sharp. It looks good and it feels good. I also am shook that you can pair it to multiple devices at the same time. This is perfect for me since my computer for school is a PC but my work computer is a MacBook.

I had such high hope for this mouse.  Some reviews indicated issues with connectivity for Mac users, but I hoped a software update would fix that.

What an epic design failure. Received the mouse, paired it with my main computer and the other 2 downloaded the software and went looking for a button to switch from device to device. Guess what? The switch button is on the bottom of the mouse, if you want to switch from device to device you have to lift and push a small button each time. This is the worst design ever. Imagine working on 2 pc's and wanting to swap between them well you can't unless you stop pick it up and push a button. Who the hell does this?  Flow?? Well that doesn't work when you have a work computer not on the same network. All in all it is a major disappointment.

Productivity is great with this mouse but you already knew that. You've seen countless reviews and youtube videos saying how the MX Master 3 is ""absolutely NOT for gaming"" which is all 100% based on the DPI. As a FPS/ platformer/ RPG gamer who owns probably a dozen wired gaming mice and a 240Hz 49"" G9, I feel they couldn't be more wrong.Yes the MM3 tops out at 4000 DPI vs the 16K or 25K on some of the other units, but it really doesn't matter. Have you ever tried to game using a mouse set at 16K+ DPI? It's crazy, the slightest touch rockets your reticle or camera from one end of the viewable area to the other, it's dizzying and frankly unenjoyable! Matter of fact, I have actually been turning DOWN the max DPI on my gaming mice for this exact reason. If you need crazy high DPI to comfortably game, God bless, I don't and doubt most do. I'm playing FarCry 6 right now on PC @ 4K DPI and the experience is fantastic. No lag, plenty of camera speed and reaction time is exactly what I need. If you've been on the fence for buying this one due to the bad gaming reviews, try it anyway, you can always return.A few other items of note... Construction is good as you would expect altho I find that the rubbery plastic material can get a little sweaty in the hand sometimes. It is a large mouse which won't be for everyone but fits my hand fine. Scroll wheels are excellent altho the side scroll rarely works, many apps just ignore it. Being able to just SPIN the middle wheel or ratchet slowly without having to push a switch button is pretty slick and here you can still change the default behavior with an available switch button. The primary buttons feel good and respond well but are super clicky, bordering on obnoxiously loud. The Logitech Options software is simple and powerful allowing full customization for any app you choose which is powerful and unique! You don't have to load or switch a full profile that remaps all your buttons based on a single game or app, it just context switches based on the app you're in at the moment. Nice! The downside is that this model doesn't have onboard memory so any customizations come through the software. But, you can cloud sync your settings so if you move your mouse between devices (which can be done via bluetooth or wireless receiver), your settings will follow you. Finally the battery life is amazing. Weeks on a charge and it still works fine when plugged in to top up via USB-C. My only complaint here is that you have to open the app to see where your battery level is, the light on the mouse only lights from waking after being left idle. And then, the app only gives you low/ medium/ high which isn't great. Gripes aside, this is my first non-gaming, non-wired mouse in a very long time and I love it.Pros:-Construction quality is excellent, shape, wheels, buttons, thumb shelf/ button-""Intelligent"" scroll wheel that both spins and ratchets depending how hard you flick-Incredible battery life, mouse stays active while charging-Bluetooth (3 devices via button on bottom) or Receiver connections-Per app customization, not just bulk profile based like others-Cloud sync via app to easily retrieve configs on different devices-4K DPI is plenty for most gamersCons:-Rubbery plastic coating gets a little sweaty-Loud very clicky primary buttons-Large, probably not great for smaller hands-No on-board memory, all configs via software-Battery level only readable via app and even then isn't exactMy rig:i7-9700K (water)32GB RAMNVME SSDs2080TIG9

It's the best mouse out there in my opinion (and I've used many)I had one weird issue where my battery perpetually showed 0 percent after only 2 days of use. Logi Options+ which is the pairing software showed it at critical levels and it would time out like the battery died, even though it was plugged in. I cracked it open and disconnected the battery for 20 seconds which fixed the problem. I wish I didn't have to peel back the pads to do so, but at least I could, and they stuck back on without much trouble. It snapped back together and has worked like a charm since.

Scrolling :I did not notice it at first but at some point I noticed the scrolling is inconsistent : making the same motion multiple times does not always result in the same scrolling, which is quite annoying. I'm not sure yet if this was just a temporary issue or a common issue. I found a few people having this issue on reddit and I tried changing the mouse settings but it did not help. I tried another wireless mouse (Razer Viper Ultimate) and I don't have this issue.EDIT : it appears to be less apparent on my work laptop, some users think this is related to wireless signal interferencesSize :Despite the mouse being larger than the G502, the grip is smaller (58mm vs 63mm according to rtings). This being said, you can grip the larger base somehow so it offers way larger than 58mm, which you can't do as easily with the G502. This is great (for me) because I think being able to switch to a larger grip makes it easier on the hand : same concept as for a chair, you need to change position to avoid ""hurting"" your body on the long run.Weight :I tried a few mice recently, the HyperX pulsefire (and cool master mm720) feels the best so far, it's much lighter so it feels effortless to move, it feels easier to be precise. The MX Master 3 is the heaviest I tried and my least favourite. If you want a lighter wireless mouse, I like the Razer Viper Ultimate which you can order with a dock, pretty useful for ""wireless charging"".Height :The MX Master height is quite high which might encourage you to put your wrist in a more extended position, which does not feel as confortable and is probably worst for the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. I guess it depends on you end up holding that mouse because there ways to avoid the extended position.DPI :No big deal but you can't set DPI via Logitech Options+, instead you set Pointer Speed. I think it would have been more logical to use the DPI approach like other mice.USB Cable :You can use the mouse while wired, which is nice. This being said, the cable is only used to charge, it can't be used to control the mouse, it only uses wireless so you can't use the mouse without the logitech Unifying usb receiver plugged in your PC and used for wireless. The usb cable is quite short, I found a workaround by pluging it in my keyboard usb port (some monitors also have usb ports).Gestures :It looked like a good idea, as long as you remember all gestures but the only useful gesture I found for me is by setting the ""click"" opens ""This PC"".Side wheel :I have keyboard corsair k70 lux rgb which also as a wheel which I integrated with Lightroom using macros in iCue, it works well. I tried doing the same with the Logitech mouse and it worked. So that's a good point (almost the only one?). But I think the best setup for Lightroom is using a MIDI controller, which I have not tried yet.I tried a few workarounds to fix some issues, like a wrist pad to help with the height, and a usb cable extender to help with dongle signal, changing the settings in Logitech Options+.For me the biggest downside is the inconsistent scrolling, it's not that bad but it's quite annoying, I tried 2 MX master 3 and both had this issue.

I got tired of hearing ""quit clicking so loud"" or ""what are you doing on the computer, I can hear you clicking something"", so I tried this clickless mouse and love it.  I can now surf in peace as this mouse is truly quite.  Plus I can easily switch this mouse from my home laptop to my work laptop to my husband's laptop without having to use the dongle.  I'm not sure on the battery life as I just started using and I don't game so am not sure how it would be for that.  But if you want to be online and not have everyone in your house complaining that they can hear you online then get this mouse!

This mouse has a lot of good features to it. I like the thumb rest button and the infinite scroll wheel the most, also being able to reprogram the buttons for different applications is really useful.I have only used the wireless dongle for the mouse, I do not have Bluetooth on my computer to test that connectivity out. The wireless dongle works very well, I haven't seen any slow response or disconnects. It does support 3 devices on Bluetooth but I haven't used the feature to see how well it works. Also you can't switch devices easily from just the mouse controls itself, you have to press the button underneath the mouse to switch to another device.I've been using it for a week now and have not had to charge it since the first charge. There is no easy way to check the charge of the mouse, you have to open the Logi options software to view its charge level. I'll have to try it in Bluetooth mode to see if it shows a charge in Windows.The only gripe I have for it is that, I have smaller hands and the mouse is quite large, I'm not able to reach all the buttons unless I adjust my hand placement each time. Due to this it's not a great mouse for gaming where you would need quick access to all the buttons on the mouse.I do wish that they had an ambidextrous version that could add more buttons, so that I could program more specific macros to them.Overall the mouse is great for productivity tasks and office applications, it is okay for gaming depending on the game you're playing, it's good for non competitive single player games, I wouldn't suggest it for competitive games that need precise actions. The wireless worked seamlessly and the software it comes with allows you to program different button actions depending on the application you're using.

Paired with the mx keys, this is an elite combo however Logitech needs to fix the connectivity issues I often face when using through the unified usb port. Sometimes it just won’t connect through despite turning each component on/off.Otherwise, great battery. Recharges through usb c. Toggle-able scroll wheel. Horizontal scroll. Extra shortcut buttons in the thumb area, and built in shortcuts for Mac OS however the Mac OS gestures are a bit finicky and sometimes laggy. Ergonomic shape is great, and logi flow when it works is useful.

I've been using it for about 2 weeks now. The build quality is really good, the scroll wheels feel great, all of the buttons feel well made too. The shape was very easy to adjust to and it fits my hand quite well. For productive tasks and for gaming its been working really well. Having the mouse connect to my laptop through bluetooth (which works flawlessly) is a life-saver with the limited amount of usb ports laptops have. I have no complaints

Have only been using it for a day now, but I'm very happy with it. Quality materials and my thumb has never been more comfortable and well rested using a mouse before. I also love the look and feel of it, very stylish. The clicks are so quiet, smooth and soft. Had no issues connecting it through bluetooth to my computer and it charged pretty quickly (will have to see how well the battery holds up). My only concern is if the thumb area will start to turn yellow with use, as another reviewer experienced, so I will be updating my review if that's the case, but even with knowing that, I wanted to get the lighter color mouse to match my white keyboard. Well worth the $$$, in my opinion.

Very comfortable. Had to get used to the scroll wheel because of how sensitive it can get but I do like how you can just glide it. Overall though, great mouse!

As compared to my previous MX Anywhere this definitely an upgrade.I use it mostly with design softwares like Sketch and Figma on a Mac.The good:- Works with Bluetooth right out of the box.- Set up is mostly straight forward- Customization options are also easy to configure.- The smart scroll is a bit weird at first but once you get used to it it's kinda nice for those extra long scrolls.- I like the ergonomics. My hand position doesn't feel weird and for my smallish hands it is a good fit.- There are a lot more Mac friendly gestures and buttons right out the box.- Easy to connect to multiple devices and switch between them.The button on the base is slightly difficult to get used to but the second scroll wheel is easy to use.The bad:- Logi Options software needs a restart before it can start recognising your mouse.- The scroll would suddenly stop working. When this happes just go into your Mac Accessibility Settings and allow Logi Options in the list along with Logi Daemon.- This was particularly bad since scroll is the most used feature and you wouldn't think of such a thing to happen.Otherwise it is a solid mouse for a variety of work flows. I haven't gamed with it but I am sure there are much better gaming mice that Logitech offers.

I have the MX Ergo, and got this one to use on multiple PCs with the MX Keys keyboard. The button to switch between PCs being on the bottom vs top with the Ergo, coupled with the much more comfortable grip on the Ergo, made me return it. Also, the Flow feature is way too frustrating to use, so the button switching was important to me.

☑️ it's great for keeping things quiet and discreet☑️ I don't like the soft click for the same reason I love mechanical keyboards☑️ I truly hope in the future they come out with an even more CLICKY MX master mouse☑️ I appreciate that this MX master version 3S offers the uber secure LOGI BOLT adapter

I love using this mouse. I have it connected to two laptops, one of them for work and can't install Logi software, but being able to quickly switch between machines is great. The only complaint would be the location of said switch; it's on the underbelly of the mouse! Other than that I have no other complaints about this device.

I watched many reviews on YouTube, and some people said they experienced pairing glitches... but I've used this for a few weeks now with no issues.

 A REVIEW (over about a month of use):It's a really well-made mouse, even if it is all plastic with the exception of the scroll wheel and the thumb wheel. The contours for my thumb and my fingers are nicely well done, but I have medium-large hands, so if you have small hands, this may not be comfortable to use. As for day to day operation, it works incredibly well, and I have yet to experience any connectivity and latency issues, double-clicking, battery issues, etc. Then again, I may have gotten lucky and recieved a unit that didn't have these problems, so I can't speak for everyone who buys this mouse.NITPICKING TIME:I did have to go on Google and download the Logitech Options driver software (pretty much the first result when you Google it) so I can customize the button layout, sensitivity, etc, but that doesn't really count as an issue (just my lazy ass). What may be an issue for some is the fact that the Logitech Options app needs to run first in order to activate your custom settings, which can be a bit annoying if you're someone who frequently shuts down and boots up or restarts their computer. I got used to it, but I am pretty patient, so beware if you're impatient.I have also noticed that the infinite scroll can be a double-edged sword at times. When I have to click to select and option of if I have enter in a special character in Word or Docs and the scroll wheel is still moving, it'll pick up on it and accidentally do something else. For example, when copying and pasting a screen shot of enterting a hyphen shortly after scrolling, the document or page's magnification will change because the scroll wheel was still spinning. I'm pretty sure you fix this in the scrolling section of the Logitech Options application or just not flick the scroll wheel as intensely (still have to get used to that part), but I'll have to see if playing with those options will fix it.VERDICT:Although I have only had this mouse for a couple of weeks to a month, I am very pleased with it. I would definitely NOT use this mouse for gaming because there's no precise DPI adjuster (just a sensitivity slider), but I use this mainly for school and browsing the internet (I have a controller dedicated to gaming). I'll update my review if any issues arise, but everything is pretty much working as promised. Is this mouse pricey? Yes. But I think that you do get what you pay for, and what I got is a pretty damn good mouse, soo...you can come to your own conclusion on that.

I've had the mouse for about a month now, and use it daily for work in the office.I honestly have zero complaints about the functionnality of the mouse or the ergonomics, it is awesome.Only problem is that because of the material used, dirt shows reaaaaaally easily on the surface of the mouse (I purchased the white one).There is stains that appear on contact points where my palm touches. I tried cleaning them with alcohol wipes, but it is hard to clean.So if that's something that bothers you, better go with the black version of the mouse.

I have been using the g502 for productivity/gaming for years. I was excited to use this mouse. But for mac you do notice a lot of lag. It bothers me. For some it may not be an issue. I feel for the price there could have been more customization and buttons. I would definitely recommend the g502 over this guy.  I personally had a lot of shortcuts programmed into the g502.Ps the touch features are not great. The ergonomics of pressing the button with your thumb is not ideal.Other than the above it’s a great mouse.

This mouse is retailed at $125.You purchase it then you get stuck in the world of Logitech compatibility issues.Like me, if you are looking to purchase the MX Master Mini keyboard ($115-125), make sure you scour the web for the MX Master 3 Professional mouse become the MX Master 3 I purchased at the end of 2021 (DEC) does not support the new Logi Bolt usb.And don’t be alarmed if once you do finally find this newer MX Master 3 Professional that the new Logi Bolt unifying receiver is not included and you will need to shell out another $25 dollars for that.So after approximately ~$275 or so dollars, time wasted trying to figure out why the damn things are no sinking together. Send back the Keyboard if you ended up purchasing it.Realizing this company is using slick promotion realizing they have two of the same products on the market with just a small tiny logo on the bottom of it.All that to say .. it is a superb mouse!! Probably the last one you’ll want to use, baring the semi Bluetooth drops.. but due to the ergonomics (fits my hand perfectly). I also have the G502 Hero for gaming; that was a year previous purchase and only reason why I gave the MX Master 3 a look after raving reviews from previous iteration owners.Great mouse.. but last investment put into Logitech! Sneaky advertising is just poor business practice!To this day they’re still swindling people on their site.You’ll love the mouse! Not the manufacturer!! And they don’t care!!!5 stars for the mouse itseft! A minus infinity to the company!

This mouse is replacing a Logitech MX Revolution which I have been using for the last 5 or so years. It has both a wireless mode (when used with the supplied USB dongle) and a Bluetooth mode.ConnectivitySince my motherboard has built-in Bluetooth, I am using this mode/option. Battery life when in Bluetooth mode is excellent. After two months of daily use the battery level dropped to 50% from fully charged.  This is definitely much better than the battery life of my MX Revolution which I typically had to recharge every 2 weeks.SoftwareThe supplied software is ok. It seems lighter in footprint than the old software that I was using with the MX Revolution. It basically allows you to configure the mouse the way you want it to work. There are default settings for various Apps like Chrome, MS Office, etc. The mouse is fully configurable if the software you are using is not in the default list. For example, I was able to configure the thumb scroll to switch between tabs when using the Firefox browser.FeaturesThe main reason I got this mouse is because of the notch-less scroll wheel which has become my favorite feature ever since I tried it on my older Logitech mice. This feature can still be switched on and off (I prefer it at notch-less most of the time) and I love how I can scroll through pages with just the flick. The wheel appear to be both heavier and smoother than ever. It does have a new mag-wheel mechanism whereby when in notch mode, it automatically switches to free-wheel or notch-less mode whenever the wheel is flicked hard enough... Going back to notch mode as the wheel slows down. I still prefer notch-less all the time but this is a nice feature for those who might want it.ErgonomicsThis is where I think my older MX Revolution beats the new MX Master 3. The MX Master 3 borders on becoming a little too big whereas the MX Revolution in my opinion is sized just right. It also takes getting used to when reaching for the back and forward buttons with your thumb. Those buttons were more readily accessible on the MX Revolution. However, the thumb scroller on the MX Master 3 is much better and more accessible than the thumb wheel on the MX Revolution. Overall I have a slight preference to the MX Master 3 over the MX Revolution mainly because of the smoother scroll wheel and also the more usable thumb scroller.Final wordsThis mouse would have been perfect if it were sized the same as my MX Revolution. However it is still an excellent mouse and I have no hesitation recommending it.

A premium feeling and performing mouse for non-gamers and professionals. High quality materials, premium feeling touch points including a soft-touch palm and thumb rest, metal scroll wheels and extremely quiet buttons. Scroll wheel can be toggled between notched and free spinning, 2 programmable side bottoms, a programmable side scroll wheel, and a programmable gesture button on the bottom of the thumb rest. Setup on my Surface Pro was non-existent. Turned it on for the first time and it was automatically synced to my device via Bluetooth. Can also be synced to 2 other devices and easily switched been them with a button on the bottom. Highly recommend.

I've been using an MX 2 for both productivity and gaming for several years, and wanted to upgrade to the latest version. The MX 3S is a nice fit for large hands, and shows no appreciable latency lag. I don't care about the vaunted silent button click, since I usually wear ANC headphones.However, it does not come with any instructions to indicate you need to go to the Logitech site to download the software to customise it and use all the features and customize the buttons and functions.Also, Logitech does not provide its control apps (Options and Options+) to the Microsoft store, only as download on its own site. This means these mice don't work well on Windows S-mode devices, since they can only run apps from the Microsoft store. The mice will function as basic, non-customizable devices in S mode, but features like the variable scroll wheel, and thumb wheel won't function without Options (or Options+). If you use an S-mode device, look for a less-expensive, basic mouse until Logitech makes Options+ available on the Microsoft store.

I already owned the MX Master mouse, and I thought I was adding the same mouse. The upgrade to the feel of the button click is the best thing about this mouse. This is a superbly built mouse with quality components. The scroll buttons are solid and comfortable. The Logi Plus customization is mind-boggling. I especially love the satisfying thumb button that I use for deleting emails. It is a satisfying click of the mouse. This is the Bentley of mice.

Obvious difference is the bolt receiver,  which for most people is just an added cost.The mouse click is also muted, which I personally learned to like. First time I  clicked it, I thought it was defective and the switch was stuck. I do miss the very distinct click from the MX3 sometimes, but for an office mouse, I think this change is for the better.I do wish they made a smaller, lower size, as this mouse is made for palm grippers, and if you have a claw grip, it is super uncomfortable.

The mouse is excellent - it's important to note that the difference between the 3 and 3S is that the click is silent. The only tech complaint I have is a singular random disconnect over the course of months upon months of 40 hour work weeks.Regarding build quality, the back foot has very slightly peeled, which is the only reason I deducted a star. I wish there was a way to store the dongle within the mouse as well, but that's not a dealbreaker. Fantastic product.

There is no problem with this mouse functionality and it’s awesome when working with but the ergonomy is not what you are expecting and there is no size available for bigger hands. For my hand, 2 of my fingers will be stacked up on the table and not on the mouse and it make my hand tired after a while, but all in all it’s not a bad mouse and you can enjoy it specially if you have smaller hands

Why so much money?  I'm not sure.  Its a mouse.  But its good.Works for my big meathooks.Sidescrolling in excel is sporadic... not sure if its a software thing or what.

It does require getting used to using this mouse.  It is heavy but grounded and firm.  The right way is to rest your hand right over it and move around by letting the mouse carry your hand weight.With my simple  (cheap)  Logitech mouse, I had to skip up and down often to get the cursor to the right point.  With this mouse, I have to change my habit of just keeping it grounded and sliding. It slides on any surface.The roll was initially tighter and one day it suddenly started just rolling loose, I had not realized that the button, just above is to switch between the controlled moving the cursor vs. the crazy spinning wheel that scrolls in a web page super fast up and down.  This is one of my favourite features about this Logitech.  The sideways spin is great too.Today, this mouse suddenly stopped working.  It turns out that my USB extension bar, where the mouse USB was attached, was faulty.  As soon as I attached it to the USB port on the computer, the mouse started working again.I purchased this about a month ago.  I use a mouse, on average, about 15 hours per day.  I work in design and web development.  This mouse is expensive, but you feel the quality right away.  As long as it keeps going, I will replace my other mice with same or a little cheaper variety.  I have difficulty using my previous mouse now, they rather feel flimsy and less controllable.  Once you use this mouse, you will not want to go back to a lesser quality mouse.

"
First off, the ergonomics are great. I noticed my grip instantly became more relaxed when I started using this mouse compared to my old one. Only potential problem with ergonomics is the pronounced uppermost bump. It fits fine in my hands with slightly more pressure than the rest of the mouse, but it could get in the way if you have smaller hands. The overall size is perfect for my medium-large sized hands and claw grip.But my favourite part is the side scroll wheel combined with the Logitech Options software. I can find a use for the side scroll wheel in almost every application, and the Options software makes it super easy to set application specific mappings.I also don't have any issues with the scroll wheel aside from SmartShift not responding well. SmartShift lets the scroll wheel spin freely but the page doesn't always scroll with it, so I just keep it off and it works a lot better. The scroll wheel is probably the best one I've ever used. The button above it allows you to quickly switch between smooth and click-to-click scrolling. I use smooth scrolling for relaxed use and click-to-click when I need to be more accurate.

J'ai presque toujours eux des souris Logitech. A chaque fois que j'allais voir ailleurs j'étais déçus.

Elle est plus grosse, en fait elle est plus grosse que tous les autre que j'ai essayer. Elle me permet de reposer toute ma main sur l'arche et je n'ai plus de douleur.

They quoted battery life of up to 70 days and now I am charging mine for the first time and it has been about 60 days since I received it.  That's pretty accurate and since I hate those gaming mice you have to charge every few days, I'm pleased with its performance.  It's very ergonomic and is great for gaming.  Overall, probably the best mouse I've ever owned in the 3 decades I've been using a PC for gaming and work.

This mouse is the best option in this price range for many people who work on desks for about 8-9 hours, as wrist pain is a real productivity killer.

The Logitech MX Master 3 is one of the most comfortable mice I've ever used. I wear medium-sized gloves and my hands rest perfectly on the shape of the mouse. I was also impressed with its battery life. I use the mouse about 8 hours a day on average and I only need to charge once every 30 days or so. As someone who uses multiple computers (PC desktop and a Macbook Pro), this mouse allows me to connect both my computers and seamlessly move between them as if they were a single computer. It even lets you copy and paste from one machine to another, which is highly useful for me. The build quality is also top-notch. The metal scroll wheels make the product feel premium, and they're super smooth as well.There are 2 side buttons that you can configure and I initially found them to be too thin/small. I did get used to them after a while so it wasn't a big deal. As for the gesture button, I have personally never used it as a gesture. I personally found it kind of slow to press down and move the mouse a certain direction to do something and I just assigned the key as a shortcut when I press it instead of using gestures.Overall, this is a fantastic mouse; the best you can get if you want a productivity mouse. However, if you're someone who plays games a lot, there are better options out there. This is a big and heavy mouse and is a very poor choice for FPS games.

I was using a 50$ wireless mouse with rechargable battery that lasted about a week. This one lasts at least a month on a single charge. And it actually tells you when its low, unlike dying mid game on my previous mouse.I personally feel like the build quality is good, some people that have used previous versions might feel this iteration not as solid. But lets be honest, inflation is going to either make things cost more, or build quality must be lowered to sell at the same price. And you don't need your mouse to be built like a rock.The scrolling is really nice. It comes with two options of smooth scroll vs. standard scroll. The smooth scroll is not very accurate so I prefer to set it to standard scroll. This would be the only negative I can think of.

Good quality mouse with tactile and smooth buttons and scroll wheel. The connection is flawless as well. The only issue I have with it is its ergonomics. It cramps my hand and kind of hurts my wrist, even when using a wrist rest pad. Maybe it's designed for bigger (mens) hands? My fingers reach everything well, but the mouse's height is quite high and I'm used to more flat mice. I'll keep using it in the hopes I adjust because it is a nice mouse.

I’ve been using another brands vertical mouse the past year, but the movement isn’t very fluid and based on all the reviews of the Mx master 3, I thought it would be good to get for work.  As others have said, it is rather large, my hands aren’t small, but this thing really feels oddly shaped in them.Also, the ergonomics of it is poor, I could feel the pull in my wrist as I used it.  The scroll wheels are nice, but they didn’t seem as fluid as I’d hoped.I’m sure it’s a great mouse for some, but just not for me.  I think I’ll go with the mx vertical.

-This mouse is not designed for medium and small hands. It is not ergonomic at all for these sizes.-This mouse is not for gaming-Mine was lagging a lot. Impossible to do any task.-Good for productivity if you have larger hands.-The scroll wheel on the left side is a bit hard to get used to. I didn't like it. It interferes with your work. You can disable it anytime but does not worth the investment.-There are plenty of better and cheaper options out there. Sometimes expansiveness is not related to suitability to develop a specific task. I am a researcher, and I always type; that's what I do for a living, but I found a cheaper option for my hand size, ' Razer Orchy V2'. Way more affordable, and if you like causal gaming, this is by far a better option.-Battery life is great.-I hope Logitech can offer more suitable solutions for middle/ small hands in the future. They don't advertise this anywhere.-Quality of the product, no complaints.

As a software professional I've bought A LOT of mice over the years.  Generally I haven't much liked wireless mice for various reasons.  But I wanted a way to use one mouse (and keyboard - I have the Logitech Ergo K860) between three computers and I have to say, the pair are really good.  I used the Logitech Unifying USB Receiver (USB dongle) instead of Bluetooth, and I use these two devices across Linux and Window computers without any trouble at all.

Mouse needs to go on diet. Its a little heavy for my liking - more like a RAT than a mouse. Even though I only move it no more than 30mm to cover my 4K monitor, the inertia required to move this beastComing back to mouse after several years on trackball. I like it but it still could be refined for long all day use.

Just comparing with the old one. The silence version has a nice touch when you click on it. Also, the shortcuts are a really nice addition. Totally recommended

I bought one for my wife (professional photographer) and she loves it. Editing pictures in Photoshop/lightroom is made easier with the customizable layout. Its saved her so much time, I actually get to spend time with here in the summer now. HIGHLY recommended for video editors as well. It'll change the way you work forever.I bought one for me because my wife had one. I use it for spreadsheets and gaming. It's changed my life as well.. never going back to a traditional mouse again. No more AA's, and the scroll wheel is orgasmic. Battery life is insane.. going on two months of constant use and they're still kicking on its first charge.

Given how much time I am now spending in the home office, I didn't want to work with go with cheap equipment that I would have to replace and I would not enjoy using. after some review, I decided on the MX Keys keyboard and MX Master 3 mouse combo. I am not at all disappointed. Excellent products. With the mouse, I am particularly fond of the smooth scrolling. I will also be purchasing a new notebook in the new year, and the ability to shift both devices on the click of a button to another system is something I am looking forward to. The ONLY thing I would see improved is I wish that they had added room for weight in the mouse, like you can with a gaming mouse. Its very ergonomic, but is on the light side.

I had used a Logitech Performance MX mouse for the past 10 years, and I liked it.  I might have bought another if it was still available.  But the 10-year-old mouse seemed to be getting glitchy, so I considered options.  I bought my wife a MX Master 2S a couple of years ago, and it was an improvement over the Performance MX.  And now, in the evolution of the product, I have this MX 3, which I think is an improvement over the 2S.  The battery life seems excellent.  The scrolling wheels and the placement of the back and forward buttons are an improvement over previous generations.  I'm very pleased and would I buy another one of these if I needed to.
",5
"
I bought this mouse to replace my aging Performance MX.  This new one has some really nice features, and some real disappointments.Pros:-I really like the shape, weight, and how this mouse fits in my hand (for the most part - see Cons section re thumbweel).-Love the new ""MagShift"" scroll wheel.  Scrolling fills me with joy again.-New Logitech Flow feature, allowing me to use one mouse and keyboard with multiple computers absolutely seamlessly.  Where has this feature been all my life?  Absolutely wonderful.Cons:-Thumbwheel is a bit of a reach and has limited applicability, except in specific applications.-Gesture button (below the thumb) is difficult to reach, and impossible to press without accidentally moving the mouse as well.-New ""Options"" software lacks the ability to set pointer acceleration.-Application specific button setup doesn't seem to work in every application.-It took many attempts to get the mouse paired with receivers on multiple computers.Overall, if it weren't for the ""Flow"" functionality, I probably would have returned this mouse.  But now that I've had a taste of that feature, I don't think I can live without it, and this is probably the best mouse I am going to find with that feature for now.

"
I have been an exclusive MX Master mouse user since the first version came out and I tend to wear out my mouse and keyboard every 2 years.Deciding whether to upgrade to version 3 or just get another 2S for half the price was a toss up this year.The deciding factor for me was the claim that it is silent when scrolling with scroll wheel click enabled.I have been using it for two days and must say that the upgrade was well worth the price. Not only is it silent when scrolling with clicks, it has a much smoother vertical and horizontal wheel scrolling. It is noticeably lighter than Master 2S.Overall I am extremely satisfied with its performance and ergonomics. Battery life will take a while to confirm but if it is anything like Master 2S, I will forget when I charged it last.
",5
"
Shape fits my medium-sized hands well. Bought this mainly due to pain felt in my thumb muscles at the thenar area. Scroll wheel is well made with intuitive ratcheting to match the scrolling speed which makes the mouse a joy to use. Overall the mouse has a very premium feel, which, coupled with its perfectly ergonomic shape, makes it very comfortable for prolonged use.
",5
"
I did not know the grey color of this mouse can stain this bad. Just a few days of usage and you can clearly see horrible stains on the mouse. I keep my work space clean and regularly clean my hands and surfaces, but even with that, the discoloration is evident. I'd recommend getting the black color of this mouse as Amazon does not replace the mouse with a different color.
",2
"
I haven't tried a MX Master mouse until this one but I'm glad I bought it. I don't use it for gaming, Logitech makes better mice for that. If you do a lot of scrolling then this is the best in my opinion. The main scroll wheel on this thing is amazing, the side one is handy to have as well. This mouse satisfied my wish to scroll at high speeds, it feels great to spin too. It's pretty expensive for a mouse but in the long run it's an investment to save time compared to regular scroll wheel mice.

It's a little bigger than my previous Microsoft Explorer mouse  I don't have a large hand so it will take some time to get accustomed to.  VERY responsive .Had issues with the Bluetooth connection, very unstable,  working great with USB connection .Battery life is extended  when the mouse goes to sleep.  I don't play games,  can't help anyone there. Looking forward to use the Flow feature.
",4
"
I love mice like this. The only issue is if you ""whip"" the mousewheel really hard it keeps travelling for a looong time, so often you'll move the mouse and it'll still be scrolling into the next window. I'm sure it can be adjusted though.Otherwise it's an amazing fit for my hand (avg size) and I use all the side buttons and wheel stuff for browsing and coding!
",5
"
After one day of using it decided to return :Pros:-Works on any surface.-Slightly better placement of charging port-Button configuration for each programCons:-MX Master 3S Does not work with old unifying receiver. If you have an older Logitech product you will end up using two usb receivers. This one does not work with the older unifying dongle and the older ones don't work with the new Bolt dongle + you have to install two Logitech software on your PC for configuring each one.-uncomfortable for large hands. It is narrower than the first MX Master and doesn't have a good grip.  While using it, my 4th finger is rubbing mouse pad. Already have sorts of pain and stiffness after using it.-Button configuration is on and off and had to run the Logitech software twice in a day of using it for using my custom configuration.
",2
"
I'm using it for software development, very handy.However, there is room for improvement.The button on the bottom feels useless, but it doesn't bother me.And the thumb roller (horizontal scroll) is too slow... it's easier to scroll with the scroll bar rather than using this roller.Other than that everything is fine. Like the mouse, the vertical scroll is good.
",5
"
The mouse feels great in my hand, is very responsive, and has crazy long battery life. Unlike an Apple mouse, you can also use it while it's charging. While you can remap the forward/back and side buttons to lots of commands, most video games won't recognize those commands as valid inputs: so you can use it for productivity OR gaming, but not both.
",5
"
I've been using this mouse for about a month now and it's absolutely fine. The smooth scrolling is a lot nicer and quieter than the 2S. Not a major difference but it is noticeable.The build quality doesn't feel as nice as the 2S but it's not huge.For some reason my hand heated up more with the mouse and would sweat but after a while I didn't notice it. It's probably due to the finish material being somewhat grippy.This is a good mouse and would not go back to the 2S however, I do wish they would up the build quality when they roll out the MX4

I love Logitech cordless mice and will not use anything else, which is why I bought this mouse in the first place, so it came as no surprise that it is perfectly ergonomically designed, but the level of customization that is possible with it did surprise me. No matter how picky you are you can customize the settings to fit your demanding requirements. It is extremely comfortable to use and the battery life is amazing. I never turn mine off and it lasts for around two months between charges. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who spends a lot of time mousing around!

This is my third MX Master. I use one at my office, and I wore out the one I use at home (literally wore a hole under my thumb). Even broken, it still worked, but I decided to get a MX Master 3. By far, this is the most comfortable and precise mouse I have ever used. History: I have been using a mouse since the original Macintosh in 1984, and I have worn through many.Pros: precision, customization, comfortCons: battery life could be better for such a large mouse
",5
"
This is the best mouse I've ever used. I have no complaints about the mouse itself.However, several times per day my back/forward buttons stop working. Normally I would fix this by reopening Logi Options+, and then I'd be good for another 12-24 hrs. After the latest Logi Options+ update, my back/forward buttons just don't work anymore. They still show the correct configuration in the software, but they don't do what they are supposed to.It's understandable for a botched software update or two, but this has been going on for months now and is only getting worse. I will not be buying Logitech again.

Cons in comparison to the original Performance MX-Only 1 year warranty instead of 3.-SHORTER : if placed comfortably in the hand my 3 fingers are too far away to click... A huge issue.-Narrower I now have my fourth finger rubbing the mouse pad instead of resting on the side of the mouse.-Lighter, no so important but feel cheaper.-Even if you put the center scroll wheel to stepped mode it switch to free roll if you turn it to fast or long enough so this button is partially useless, at least it can be mapped to something else. (like switching mouse resolution)Pro-I love the horizontal scroll wheel-Button/wheels can be configured for each program which is greatSadly as I use my mouse sometime more then 12 hours per day if the comfort is not perfect I will injure myself. I already feel a slight pain and stiffness after only one short day !I will have to return this mouse and buy parts to repair my old Performance MX v1. An Omron mini switch cost a couple dollars!This is a shame since I found the horizontal scroll wheel very useful.

The mouse in general is very nice, but don't know why, only used it a few times, right now when I click on the side key, it has a very cheap loud plastic noise, a much bigger noticeable noise than all the other keys. For this money, and for this quality, I'm very disappointed. Don't know how they controled the quality.

I use this at work and it's fantastic for that. Haven't gamed with it, but it's not a gaming mouse, I use a Razer at home for that. Also can't comment on battery life just yet, other than to say that the battery definitely lasts longer than the couple weeks I've had it.Update - I've been using this mouse 11+ hours a day, 7 days a week for the last three weeks. It started with a full charge and I just got the prompt to plug it in.
",5
"
I am very pleased with this mouse. Feels comfortable in the hand and the free scrolling feature is quite cool. I love using the thumb buttons to navigate web pages. The thumb scroller and special thumb button at the base are not always easy to find, but this likely depends on the size of your hands. I got this with the Mx Keys keyboard for Mac/Linux workflow, and although I primarily still use my gen 1 Apple trackpad, I am very pleased with the purchase.

Everything works awesome with the dongle.  Only used on Windows PC's but sometimes is unresponsive on a Bluetooth connection for a few seconds every now and then.

The rubbery/soft-touch plastic that covers the entire palm and thumb area degraded in under 6 months of usage. No sweaty gaming was ever done with this mouse.Once it started degrading, the mouse became sticky to the touch and gets worse/slimy as it gets warm after even just light use. Suspect my grip style that has my entire palm and thumb in contact with the mouse has something to do with it as it gets warmer than I would like a mouse to be.Logitech has replaced it under warranty, but how long the replacement will last is what's keeping me from using it. Would have much preferred this to be all ABS plastic instead of the soft touch rubber material.

Logitech has always been known for their wireless keyboards and mice, and this one is no exception. In 2016, Logitech was the first to create a wireless technology that has no interference with other wireless devices, and can respond as fast as a wired mouse plugged in via USB. Ever since, Logitech's wireless Logitech MX Master 3 mice have been outstanding in terms of performance.

Died within a year of use, sad. Bad quality, the mouse wheel lock mechanism broke, and clicking doesn't work half the time. Not even a year of use. Just poor build/part quality. About 8 hours of use a day for work, 5 times a week for the last 7 months. At first I thought it was the drivers, nope, it's the mouse itself. You click somewhere, it doesn't register as a click although you're clicking. Also stops tracking intermittently. The mouse wheel lock mechanism is broken as well, instead of doing the tactile hard scroll it just goes and goes. Tested this on multiple machines.Now, when it actually works, pretty sweet. But, I mean, less than a year and it's dead? Garbo, not going for logitech products after this mouse. It's not an inexpensive product too.

It is expensive but honestly the best mouse money can buy I love it ... My work environment consists of a MacBook pro and a Windows PC desktop and I love the fact that I can connect to both machines with one mouse and keyboard and freed up some space on my desk by getting rid of the keyboard and mouse that I was using for my desktop... If you're thinking about buying it ... Go ahead do it and you'll thank me later 😁

Good money wasted and life-long customer lost Logitech.  I am sad to put you behind me but dependability is key!

The shape is not as ergonomic as it first appears, but I do have bigger hands. The mouse is a little too big for finger grip and too heavy for intense gaming, but it really works fine for anything else, like office work. The sensor can work on glass too, which is a big bonus.

Logitech makes great products and this is one of them.  However, this mouse did not work out for me.  It's too small for my medium hands.

I have used logitech mice for years. This probably my number 10 or more. The precision is excellent but the sharp I find is not as good as what I expected from it. Putting my hand on it feels okay but it does not feel as good when I use it for a while. I got tired. I don't understand. I didn't have that kind of feeling before or at least not as much.

Ordered one of these in December 2020 and it worked perfectly. They then got sold out and became in-stock again some time in March 2021. They must've changed manufacturers or materials (or BOTH) because the new one I order in March 2021 has a very loud left and right mouse button clicks and a whizzing sound from the scroll wheel. These sounds are non-existent in the one I ordered in December 2020.I tried getting a replacement and the issue still persists. They definitely changed manufacturers or materials (or BOTH) for the new batch of product

While I would love to give this mouse 5 stars, it has a critical flaw that makes me hate it. Whenever I start my computer, the mouse is on a default ""smooth"" scrolling when I personally prefer the Ratchet. It is essntially impossible to switch it to ratchet without opening the software which takes forever to open. If you dont mind, this mouse is for you. If you do mind the smooth scroll, stay away from this mouse.

I gave this mouse a solid 3 weeks of testing and I'm not switching to anything else.I love it. The MX master 3 seems to be made for my large hands (6'3"" dude).It's superbly smooth, I work across 3 monitors all day and draw for most of it. The mouse is my bread and butter tool.The software is an executable that I was able to install at work - even with our super-tight security settings- so that's a HUGE plus. You can configure the buttons and scroll wheels to what you like. For me that means complex bind-keys on my keyboard for my cad software can now be one click...I haven't figured out what to configure the thumb wheel yet, I tried volume, but it can go up when you least expect it if you brush the wheel by mistake with your thumb.The main scroll wheel is divine. If you give it a rapid spin, the magnetic mechanism releases it and it free spins, so you want to scroll down to page a million in some code, no problem.It's great that it's wireless, and I use the dongle it comes with since my pc has no bluetooth (yea, I design parts of phones for next year with old computers, go figure).Did I mention the mouse accuracy is amazing?Give this mouse a go if you work with the mouse ALL day and want extra comfort with amazing precision and customizable buttons.I have nothing bad to say and only excellent experience with it so far.

This mouse is super comfortable - the ergonomic features are awesome! I do a lot of scrolling and it's so easy with this mouse, it's really responsive.

This mouse has to be close to the perfect shape that a mouse could ever be. If you reach out with your hand like you are reaching for a mouse, that's the shape it is.  It feels perfectly natural in your hand. It also feels sturdy and very well made. The mouse wheel has just the right amount of resistance when scrolling (line by line precise clicks) but give it a flick and it automatically goes into freewheeling mode (very cool feature). The left and right mouse buttons are long so they can accommodate a wide variety of finder lengths. The thumb rest is great and keep you from dragging your thumb all over the pad. The thumb wheel on the side scrolls left and right (test it out in a spread sheet). Under the thumb wheel is the back and forward buttons and below that under your thumb on the thumb rest there is another button (changes desktops etc). on the under side the 123 switch changes the monitor.It has very long battery life between charges (maybe three to four weeks).On the down side the only thing I could think of to complain about is the size of the power button. It is smaller than I like. I hate messing with a mini buttons although it's not as small as most. Put a power button on top or a larger slider on the bottom.The price is slightly excessive but you get what you pay for.

 I have a long and successful relationship with Logitech mice, but this particular one didn't win my heart.What I didn't like the most, it's the scrolling wheel.It is adjustable and quite comfortable, but still, its spin is too light for my taste, for I prefer the rubberized wheel's tight movements.MX Master 3 is highly customizable, so for gamers, it should be a big catch. As for daily use, I suggest a much cheaper, but amazingly comfortable and reliable mouse Logitech M510. I'm using it right and couldn't be happier.The build of MX Master 3 suggests a big and wide hand, rather than a small one. My husband has an XXL hand, and MX Master 3 was just the right size for him. For my S sized hand, the mouse was too high, and it created an uncomfortable angle to my wrist.The bottom line, MX Master 3 is a high-quality product but must be tried in terms of ergonomics and wheel preferences.

By just looking at the price, it is such an expensive computer mouse. However, it does have a lot of nice features. The ergonomic design makes it very comfortable to hold and use. The thumb wheel and controls are placed strategically. The scrolling is super fast and precise. Another important feature is the fast charging and long battery life. This is an impressive computer mouse. If you do a lot of gaming and extensive work on a computer, it is for you.

I love the way the Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse - Graphite looks and works. The mouse is smooth and the keys are thoughtfully placed. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is a bit too tall for my hand (I have relatively smallish hands). It think it is a great product, but not necessarily for small hands.

I was looking forward to a more ergonomic mouse and was hoping this would do the trick. So far after weeks of use I still can't get used to the way it handles and the mushy buttons. There are some good points but overall I don't like it.► I like the looks and appreciate the rubberized exterior which makes it easy to hang on to, I wish all mice were set up like this. I also like the weight, I prefer a mouse that feels like I'm actually holding onto something.► This is the first mouse I've got my hands on that uses a type C USB cable for charging (included) and I've not had any problems using it while connected to a USB cable for charging.► Forward/backward buttons are placed nicely and have decent action on them. They are also small enough to not get in the way or be activated when not desired but big enough to easily feel when running a thumb across them.For me, there was one thing that really stood out, the idea that this mouse could be used across different systems seamlessly. Yes software would need to be installed and connection would require both the dongle and Bluetooth but if it worked it could save me time and desk space as I could eliminate two other mice.The concept here is great, this could be a real bonus for those of us who do a lot of work between computers but while the concept is great the execution is not. I found that the software wasn't always working seamlessly. The idea is that you have one mouse that can be used across different systems. We would be able to copy files between different computers as well as use the mouse seamlessly between them. While this works it has it's flawed, primarily the problem is that it sometimes stops functioning without any apparent reason. I've also had issues where a file I was transferring didn't get copied over. Nothing out of the ordinary, things like 200kb PDF's.I was also intrigued to see how well the scroll wheel would work. It's touted as ""Ultrafast Magspeed Electromagnetic Scrolling"" but it results in sloppy performance. What's that supposed to mean anyway? Yes, there is the ability to scroll super fast through a long document or web page but when control is needed to stop, go backward, or back to a specific point that I just flew past the control isn't there. I don't immediately get the same speed backward and this then results in a lot of scrolling back up again.► The scroll wheel itself is decent, the metal has decent knurling which keeps it from being slippery and there are mild indents that you can feel when scrolling.► Left and right mouse buttons are too soft and give almost no tactile feedback that the button has been pressed.► The left/right scroll wheel located above the back/forward buttons is difficult to use, it sits recessed too far and offers a lot of resistanceUsing the software allows for some customization such as button actions and DPI settings but there is nothing spectacular.► On the upside like the other Logitech products, I own the battery life is great. This is one aspect of wireless products that the company is excellent at.► Pad's on the bottom are also good, the whole thing slides nicely over both metallic and neoprene based mousepads and the sensor tracks on any surface I've tried it on.If the tech inside worked as designed it would be worth the money but as it is I couldn't recommend spending this much for poor to wonky performance not to mention the poor action on the two main buttons.

Very comfortable, intuitive interface and high quality components here!  Very pleased to see the USB C charge port.  Surfing and word processing right out of the box, I look forward to using this mouse for some video editing.

This mouse is SUPER comfortable to use; it's very ergonomic. It's simple plug & play and the software is pretty straightforward to use. I really enjoy the magnetic scroll wheel. That wheel should be a standard. It tracks smooth and does its job perfectly. So far so good.

This Logitech mouse works very well! It’s been used for routine computer work & games. It’s worked perfectly on every surface it’s been used on. Very responsive. A great change from using a laptop touch pad.
